Even societies without written language left crafted artifacts, cave art and monuments that have been interpreted as having magical purpose. Magic and what would later be called science were often practiced together, with the notable examples of astrology and alchemy, before the Scientific Revolution of the late European Renaissance moved to separate science from magic on the basis of repeatable observation. Despite this loss of prestige, the use of magic has continued both in its traditional role, and among modern occultists who seek to adapt it for a scientific world.

Magic was invoked in many kinds of rituals and medical formulae, and to counteract evil omens. Defensive or legitimate magic in Mesopotamia (*asiputu* or *masmassutu* in the Akkadian language) were incantations and ritual practices intended to alter specific realities. The ancient Mesopotamians believed that magic was the only viable defense against demons, ghosts, and evil sorcerers.[1] To defend themselves against the spirits of those they had wronged, they would leave offerings known as *kispu* in the person's tomb in hope of appeasing them.[2] If that failed, they also sometimes took a figurine of the deceased and buried it in the ground, demanding for the gods to eradicate the spirit, or force it to leave the person alone.[3]
 
The ancient Mesopotamians also used magic intending to protect themselves from evil sorcerers who might place curses on them.[4] Black magic as a category didn't exist in ancient Mesopotamia, and a person legitimately using magic to defend themselves against illegitimate magic would use exactly the same techniques.[4] The only major difference was the fact that curses were enacted in secret;[4] whereas a defense against sorcery was conducted in the open, in front of an audience if possible.[4] One ritual to punish a sorcerer was known as Maql, or "The Burning".[4] The person viewed as being afflicted by witchcraft would create an effigy of the sorcerer and put it on trial at night.[4] Then, once the nature of the sorcerer's crimes had been determined, the person would burn the effigy and thereby break the sorcerer's power over them.[4]
 
The ancient Mesopotamians also performed magical rituals to purify themselves of sins committed unknowingly.[4] One such ritual was known as the Šurpu, or "Burning",[5] in which the caster of the spell would transfer the guilt for all their misdeeds onto various objects such as a strip of dates, an onion, and a tuft of wool.[5] The person would then burn the objects and thereby purify themself of all sins that they might have unknowingly committed.[5] A whole genre of love spells existed.[6] Such spells were believed to cause a person to fall in love with another person, restore love which had faded, or cause a male sexual partner to be able to sustain an erection when he had previously been unable.[6] Other spells were used to reconcile a man with his patron deity or to reconcile a wife with a husband who had been neglecting her.[7]
 
The ancient Mesopotamians made no distinction between rational science and magic.[8][9][10] When a person became ill, doctors would prescribe both magical formulas to be recited as well as medicinal treatments.[9][10][11] Most magical rituals were intended to be performed by an *āšipu*, an expert in the magical arts.[9][10][11][12] The profession was generally passed down from generation to generation[11] and was held in extremely high regard and often served as advisors to kings and great leaders.[13] An āšipu probably served not only as a magician, but also as a physician, a priest, a scribe, and a scholar.[13]

The Sumerian god Enki, who was later syncretized with the East Semitic god Ea, was closely associated with magic and incantations;[14] he was the patron god of the *bārȗ* and the *ašipū* and was widely regarded as the ultimate source of all arcane knowledge.[15][16][17] The ancient Mesopotamians also believed in omens, which could come when solicited or unsolicited.[18] Regardless of how they came, omens were always taken with the utmost seriousness.[18]
 
A common set of shared assumptions about the causes of evil and how to avert it are found in a form of early protective magic called incantation bowl or magic bowls. The bowls were produced in the Middle East, particularly in Upper Mesopotamia and Syria, what is now Iraq and Iran, and fairly popular during the sixth to eighth centuries.[19][20] The bowls were buried face down and were meant to capture demons. They were commonly placed under the threshold, courtyards, in the corner of the homes of the recently deceased and in cemeteries.[21]
 
In ancient Egypt (*Kemet* in the Egyptian language), Magic (personified as the god *heka*) was an integral part of religion and culture which is known to us through a substantial corpus of texts which are products of the Egyptian tradition.[22]
 
While the category magic has been contentious for modern Egyptology, there is clear support for its applicability from ancient terminology.[23] The Coptic term *hik* is the descendant of the pharaonic term *heka*, which, unlike its Coptic counterpart, had no connotation of impiety or illegality, and is attested from the Old Kingdom through to the Roman era.[23] *Heka* was considered morally neutral and was applied to the practices and beliefs of both foreigners and Egyptians alike.[24] The Instructions for Merikare informs us that *heka* was a beneficence gifted by the creator to humanity "... in order to be weapons to ward off the blow of events".[25]
 
Magic was practiced by both the literate priestly hierarchy and by illiterate farmers and herdsmen, and the principle of *heka* underlay all ritual activity, both in the temples and in private settings.[26]
 
After a person died, his or her corpse would be mummified and wrapped in linen bandages to ensure that the deceased's body would survive for as long as possible[33] because the Egyptians believed that a person's soul could only survive in the afterlife for as long as his or her physical body survived here on earth.[33] The last ceremony before a person's body was sealed away inside the tomb was known as the Opening of the Mouth.[33] In this ritual, the priests would touch various magical instruments to various parts of the deceased's body, thereby giving the deceased the ability to see, hear, taste, and smell in the afterlife.[33]
 
The *Book of the Dead* is made up of a number of individual texts and their accompanying illustrations. Most sub-texts begin with the word *ro*, which can mean "mouth", "speech", "spell", "utterance", "incantation", or "chapter of a book". This ambiguity reflects the similarity in Egyptian thought between ritual speech and magical power.[35] In the context of the *Book of the Dead*, it is typically translated as either *chapter* or *spell*. In this article, the word *spell* is used.
 
At present, some 192 spells are known,[36] though no single manuscript contains them all. They served a range of purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum.[37] Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.
 
The texts and images of the *Book of the Dead* were magical as well as religious. Magic was as legitimate an activity as praying to the gods, even when the magic was aimed at controlling the gods themselves.[39] Indeed, there was little distinction for the Ancient Egyptians between magical and religious practice.[40] The concept of magic (*heka*) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word. The act of speaking a ritual formula was an act of creation;[41] there is a sense in which action and speech were one and the same thing.[40] The magical power of words extended to the written word. Hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by the god Thoth, and the hieroglyphs themselves were powerful. Written words conveyed the full force of a spell.[41] This was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted, as often occurred in later *Book of the Dead* scrolls, particularly if the accompanying images were present.[42] The Egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it; thus, the *Book of the Dead* equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife, giving him power over them.[43]
 
The spells of the *Book of the Dead* made use of several magical techniques which can also be seen in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a *Book of the Dead* papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy.[39] Everyday magic made use of amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value.[44] A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva.[39]
 
*Halakha* (Jewish religious law) forbids divination and other forms of soothsaying, and the Talmud lists many persistent yet condemned divining practices.[45] Practical Kabbalah in historical Judaism, is a branch of the Jewis
