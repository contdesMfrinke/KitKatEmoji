Since there are already several articles about f.lux on Glarminy (see here, here, and here) the focus of this article will be on Iris and how it compares to f.lux (in anti-CVS effectiveness). Six other popular blue light filter apps are also mentioned. These are not considered as the best for CVS prevention because of an inferior blue filtering technique. The article first mentions the functionalities that Iris and f.lux do equally well. Next, the anti-CVS capabilities offered in Iris but not in f.lux are described. Finally, the article reveals the functionalities that could potentially help reduce computer eye fatigue but are yet to be fully implemented in Iris.

**f.lux**: Free, simple to use for insomnia, a bit trickier for CVS. If your objective is only to fight digital screen induced insomnia and you want it for free f.lux is your best blue light app because it provides a greater range of CCT settings than the free versions of Iris.
 
**Iris Mini Pro**(purchase license here): Minimalistic, simple to use. Among the many hidden features, two stand out as great value for CVS sufferers: the color invert, and unlimited blue light control. Perfect against CVS and/or insomnia if you principally need blue light, and/or brightness control, and/or color invert.
 
**Iris Pro** (purchase license here): More tools to relieve CVS (plus a few new ones to be implemented) than any other blue light app. There are also many additional features not related to CVS or Insomnia. It is great for both CVS and/or insomnia. Purchasing the license now entitles you to all future updates.
 
On most (if not all) screens, it is impossible to completely eliminate blue light emissions with a blue light filter app, i.e. through software/electronic manipulation. However, with very low correlated color temperature (CCT) settings, e.g. 1900K or 1200K, it is possible to get relatively close (see table below).

Disclaimer: I am very sensitive to computer screens, particularly computer blue light. So keep in mind that this article on best blue light filter apps is written by a demanding user. However, I am not a vision expert.
 
Both blue light and low contrast make your eyes strain more which may cause computer eye fatigue. When you use software to reduce blue light emissions of your screen you are bound to lose some contrast. When it comes to CVS, what separates the best blue light filter apps from the rest is their approach to filtering blue light.
 
There are two approaches for filtering blue light: the transparent overlay approach and the color transform approach. **Color transform preserves contrast considerably better** (see the explanation of the maker of f.lux, with numbers to prove it).
 
f.lux and Iris use the superior, color transform, approach (and are the only blue light filter apps that do so. Please let me know if you know of another!?). Hence, they are considered as the best blue light apps for CVS prevention in this article.
 
There are many blue light filter apps in the market. They tend to focus on sleep disruption, not computer eye strain prevention. Moreover, they use the inferior, transparent overlay approach to filter blue light (previous section). However, judging by their popularity, transparent overlay must be tolerable by those who need a blue light filter app primarily to improve their sleep.
 
Digital screen high-frequency flicker is a frequent cause of eye strain and headaches in people who are more sensitive to it. Flicker is a rapid and repetitive variation in light source output (between ON and OFF, or higher and lower brightness). High-frequency flicker is invisible to our eyes, however, our brain still detects it and in some people leads to eye strain and headaches.
 
Flicker is often worse when a screen is being used at lower brightness levels. This is due to the use of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control screen brightness. PWM is a method used to reduce the perceived brightness by making the OFF (or lower brightness) longer at the cost of the ON (or higher brightness) state. The resulting flicker is still invisible as such. Instead, what we perceive is lower screen brightness. (For more info on flicker see this presentation or this leaflet by U.S. Department of Energy).
 
Inevitably the downside of any dimming is the loss of contrast. If you overdo it your eyes will feel it sooner or later. For that reason, Iris or f.lux brightness control is more suitable for black text on light backgrounds, white in particular.
 
To people who suffer from computer eye strain Iris offers several CVS-reducing features that are not available in f.lux: **maximum customizability of blue light output, color inversion and color effects, timer and break reminder, automatic brightness control,**and**font rendering**.
 
In f.lux CCT settings go as low as 2700K. It is possible to enable lower CCT settings (2300K, 1900K, and 1200K) but these only apply to night time. (You can get around this limitation by setting the clock on your computer such that f.lux thinks it is night time when you normally use your computer screen. For example, you could move your PC clock 12 hours ahead.
 
If you work in a relatively dark room (as I must to avoid on-screen glare and reflections) or just prefer black background on your screen, you can use the color inversion function (a hidden feature in Iris Mini Pro). Color inversion makes your screen look like its negative.
 
Color inversion may be very useful in some programs and settings. However, as you can see in the image above, the color inversion may make some fields (like the menu bar in the image above) too bright for long term visual comfort. Elsewhere (menu bar on the left) the contrast between the different shades of red may be uncomfortably low. Moreover, it appears that some people find black background psychologically unpleasant. Therefore for long hours of text editing or spreadsheet work, it might be preferable to use a combination of customizing your colors (see this article for Windows 10) and reducing blue light with Iris/f.lux.
 
Taking breaks is good for your eyes and body. The eyes are particularly challenged and under a lot of stress when reading from a screen. Giving them time to relax by focusing on distant objects is another key anti eye fatigue measure. The timer implemented in Iris can help remind you to give your body and eyes a break. Alternatively, you can use one of many other anti-repetitive-strain apps in combination with f.lux or Iris Mini but it might be handier to have it all in one app.
 
The Iris Pro timer allows you to set the frequency of your breaks (the default is every 30 min) and break duration (default: 3min). Moreover, you can also: set the postpone time; whether you want the rest screen to close automatically; and whether you want to use sounds.
 
So, if you happen to work in an office depending largely on natural lighting, you should definitely consider switching on Use automatic brightness, under the Artificial Intelligence (AI) heading in Iris Pro.
 
Font selection is extremely important to avoid computer eye strain and headaches. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to find conclusive research on which font and text-rendering method provides greater visual comfort. Given this void, Iris Pro tries to help by making it very easy to switch between different text-rendering methods. In that way, you can easily compare what works best for you and on your screen/computer setup.
 
Iris Pro provides an easy way to switch between different text rendering methods: Anti-aliasing fonts, GDIPP (Apple-like rendering for Windows), ClearType fonts, and Simple fonts. Try the different text-rendering methods and see which one works best for you and on your computer screen. After all, it could be that what is best for you does not depend only on the specifics of your visual system, but also on the specifics of the screen and color theme you are using.
 
Suggesting exercises for the eyes, neck, back, etc. could also prove useful to some CVS sufferers. Many anti-repetitive strain injury apps do that. The Iris pricing page features exercises as one of the capabilities of Iris Pro, but it is not to be found on the Iris Pro menu.
 
I tested four versions of Iris (for Windows): Iris Mini, Iris Mini Pro, Iris and Iris Pro. The Pro versions are not free, but not expensive either considering how much they can help you improve computer eye strain.
 
**Iris Mini** (free download here) provides limited blue light and brightness control options but enough if you are not very sensitive to computer light and also enough to give you a flavor for the excellent, minimalistic simplicity of Iris Mini Pro.
 
It is really easy and quick to switch between the modes. You just click on the Iris icon in your taskbar to move from Automatic mode to Manual. Click again to move to Paused mode and the next click brings you back to Automatic mode.
 
**Iris Mini Pro**(purchase license here) was great! Simple, minimalistic, perfect. To move between the three modes you just click on the Iris icon on the taskbar. But in addition, it gives you access to 8 settings for blue light reduction, 4 settings for brightness and many other hidden features (full customization of blue light blocked and brightness, invert, etc.).
 
**Iris**(free download here) is a bigger blue light filter app. The free version allows you to use its timer (with pre-set break frequency of every 30 minutes). You can also determine whether you want to use the timer in productive, strict, or normal mode.
 
Your monitor should not actually adapt to the Sunlight but to the light around you and the light in your room. You can achieve this with light detection from the camera or from the easy manual control of the brightness.
