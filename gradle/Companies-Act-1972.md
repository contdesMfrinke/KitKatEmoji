The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. The basis of the CWA was enacted in 1948 and was called the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, but the Act was significantly reorganized and expanded in 1972. "Clean Water Act" became the Act's common name with amendments in 1972.
 
Under the CWA, EPA has implemented pollution control programs such as setting wastewater standards for industry. EPA has also developed national water quality criteria recommendations for pollutants in surface waters.
 
The Office of Water (OW) ensures drinking water is safe, and restores and maintains oceans, watersheds, and their aquatic ecosystems to protect human health, support economic and recreational activities, and provide healthy habitat for fish, plants, and wildlife.

Brinks, Garda and IBI pledged to electrify just 48 percent, 34 percent and 14 percent of their fleets in exchange for the right to idle on city streets with impunity, according to their variance requests posted online by DEP on Wednesday.
 
If granted, the variances would give the companies a free pass to let their gas-powered vehicles idle on city streets without the threat of DEP fines. All four firms have received significant numbers of tickets via DEP's citizen enforcement program, which rewards complainants with a 25-percent bounty if companies are found guilty.
 
"I've been quite explicit ... about the extent to which vehicle electrification is the way we end idling once and for all," DEP Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala told Streetsblog this week. "I believe very strongly that the variance we gave last year to Loomis was entirely justified and exactly the right kind of plan that we should reward."
 
"They had a fairly aggressive timetable for a nearly complete electrification," the commissioner said of Loomis. "That is precisely the kind of fleet changeover that I would like to reward. From my point of view, the fact that they were an armored car was far less relevant than the fact that they came to the table with a concrete plan to end idling."
 
Brinks, one of the city's top idling violators, will install "idle reduction technology" on the portion of its fleet that remains gas-powered, according to its variance request. Vehicles will only idle for "driver safety," the company claimed.
 
"I think of these as get-out-of-fines-free cards," said Hayden Brockett of the New York City Clean Air Collective. "DEP has already shown that they're willing to trade our health for empty promises from one corporation, and I think that's why Brinks and Garda are out here trying to get the same deal.
 
"The engine must remain running during stops to ensure the operability of security systems, temperature regulators, and operational protocol necessary to safety of all parties," according to a 2022 letter from the National Armored Car Association included in both Garda's and Brink's application.
 
All three armored car companies have made moves to purchase EVs, but IBI insisted in its request that it is still developing "an armored unit with enough battery life to provide continuous power to all ... electronic systems." Garda claimed "diligent research" failed to identify a "viable and commercially available" way to "power the ventilation, security systems and permit immediate access to engine power ... without engine idling."
 
Those claims ignore the reality on the ground, citizen enforcers told Streetsblog. Many of the companies' idling violations occur when the vehicles are not in the process of making deliveries, they said. If the average stop takes 10 minutes, as Garda claims, there's no reason a truck would run out of battery power.
 
"If they drive, the engine is on. By doing so, they charge their batteries. So like any other car, when they stop for a few minutes, that doesn't mean they're incapacitated," one regular citizen complainant, Patrick Schnell, told Streetsblog. "If you shut off your engine, it's not like you're going to be dead in five minutes. I don't think this is an imminent threat to life."
 
"They need to stop idling today. Just because they also electrify their fleet is not an argument that they can't stop idling today," Schnell said. "They've had 50 years to do something about [this]. They've flouted the law for 50 years."
 
The city's administrative code allows the DEP commissioner to grant variances to air pollution regulations if companies can present "adequate proof" that the regulation "would impose unreasonable hardship." Companies must petition for such exemptions.
 
The four proposed variances will get hearings on May 29, when the public will be able to comment, DEP said. (DEP also takes comments online at this link.) The agency will then decide whether to allow the exemptions.
 
"New York City is doing a really impressive job of electrifying its fleet, including, in many cases, medium and heavy duty vehicles, that people only a year or two ago were saying could never be electrified," he said. "DEP and the city government are walking the walk on vehicle electrification."
 
"When a vehicle idles, it releases very harmful pollutants in the air," said Suhali Mndez from New York Lawyers for the Public Interest. "Even once the smoke clears, there is very, very harmful particulate matter that causes cardiac as well as respiratory issues."
 
Under the settlement, Sirius XM has rights through Dec. 31, 2017, for the music recordings from ABKCO Music & Records, Capitol Records, Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Music Group. The deal resolves the lawsuit the companies filed against Sirius XM in September 2013.
 
Sirius XM declined to comment on the settlement. In a regulatory filing Friday, the company provided details about the agreement in the case, Capitol Records LLC et al. v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
 
In this divestiture action under 7 of the Celler-KefauverAntimerger Act, the Government challenged the acquisition byappellant, Ford, the second largest automobile manufacturer, ofcertain assets of Electric Autolite Co. (Autolite), an independentmanufacturer of spark plugs and other automotive parts. Theacquisition included the Autolite trade name, Autolite's onlydomestic spark plug plant, and extensive rights to its nationwidedistribution organization for spark plugs and batteries. The brandused in the spark plug replacement market (aftermarket) hashistorically been the same as the original equipment (OE) brand.Autolite and other independents had furnished manufacturers with OEplugs at or below cost, seeking to recoup their losses byprofitable aftermarket sales. Ford, which previously had bought allits spark plugs from independents and was the largest purchaserfrom that source, made the Autolite acquisition in 1961 for thepurpose of participating in the aftermarket. At about that time,General Motors (GM) had about 30% of the domestic spark plugmarket. Autolite had 15%, and Champion, the only other majorindependent, had 50% (which declined to 40% in 1964, and 33% in1966). The District Court found that the industry's oligopolisticstructure encouraged maintenance of the OE tie, and that spark plugmanufacturers, to the extent that they are not owned by automakers, will compete more vigorously for private brand sales in theaftermarket. The court held that the acquisition of Autoliteviolated 7, since its effect "may be substantially to lessencompetition" in automotive spark plugs because: (1) "as both aprime candidate to manufacture and the major customer of thedominant member of the oligopoly," Ford's pre-acquisition positionwas a moderating influence on the independent companies, and (2)the acquisition significantly foreclosed to independent spark plugmanufacturers access to the purchaser of a substantial share of thetotal industry output. After hearings, the court ordered thedivestiture of the Autolite plant and trade name because of theindustry's oligopolistic structure, which encouraged
 
maintenance of the OE tie. The court stressed that it was in theself-interest of the OE spark plug manufacturers to discourageprivate brand sales, but noted that changes in marketing methodsindicated a substantial growth in the private brand sector of thespark plug market, which, if allowed to develop without unlawfulrestraint, may account for 17% of the total aftermarket by 1980.Additionally, the court enjoined Ford for 10 years frommanufacturing spark plugs; ordered it for five years to buyone-half its annual requirements from the divested plant under the"Autolite" name, during which time it was prohibited from using itsown name on spark plugs; and, for 10 years, ordered it to continueits policy of selling to its dealers at prices no less than itsprevailing minimum suggested jobbers' selling price. In contestingdivestiture, Ford argued that under its ownership Auto
