**Country Woods:**  
On the Country Woods track,once you get past two or three 90 degree turns, you should come to a really sharp hairpin, (look for it on the map display) once you come to that, you see a little hill of snow off to the side of the road. Go up the hill, then cut the wheel sharp to realign yourself with the track.This gives you an enormous amount of ground!

**Empire City:**  
The first shortcut is almost immediately after you start the race. The shortcut is on the left, right before you see the crane, there is also a street light almost inside the shortcut.
 
After you come out of the second shortcut there is a cement barrier directly ahead of you. Slightly to the left of this there are several flashing barriers, go through these and follow the path. Be sure to turn to the left so that you can head in the right direction on the track.
 
The fourth shortcut is after you pass through the lighted tunnel and a row of pillars (the second long row of pillars you have come across). Right after you pass all of the pillars go into the lighted area to the right. Stay in this area until the lights end. Right when the lights end there is a miscolored part of the wall with flyers on it. Run through the wall and you are inside the shortcut.
 
**Hometown:**  
On the Hometown track, right before the first covered bridge, there's a stretch of grass before and in the turn. Cut through the grass right before the turn, then let the car slide up to the left side of the track, don't get too close to the side of the bridge though.This tip should cut off a few seconds from your time, it will also boost your speed for the upcoming jump.
 
**Red Rock Ridge:**  
In redrock ridge, there is a shortcut through the hairpin, right before it, there is a place to pull over on the right, drive through there, and powerslide left right before the cactus, then go straight forward through the cleared area, and turn left onto the road. This helps when you're being chased by the cops, they have to take the hairpin, so you can lose them.
 
Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is a tenth anniversary re-release of Need for Speed Hot Pursuit (2010) with all of its previously released updates and downloadable content. Unleash a savage sense of speed both as an outlaw and a cop in the world's hottest high-performance cars. Outsmart the heat or take down lawbreakers with the tactical weaponry at your disposal in a heart-pumping, socially competitive racing experience.
 
Roadblocks can crash you out if you are a Racer and you hit them dead on. If you have no other choice, and it is inevitable that you are going to hit the roadblock you need to get your car into a drift first. Drifting makes your car more resistant to being crashed out. If you manage to drift through the gap in a roadblock you will lose a little speed and take a bit of damage, but you will still be able to continue going. The damage you take won't be as much as a Spike or EMP.
 
Don't use nitro while drifting as this maneuver is slowing you down anyway. The only time you should use nitrous while drifting is when you want to straighten your car up at the end of a drift and set it quickly in the right direction. The best way to use your nitro is to save if for the straights. Saving and using it in one go is generally the best way. Especially as a racer.
 
In order to inflict damage to other cars you need to hit them in their rear bumper and sides. If your slams hit the front bumbper or front quarter panel of another car you will be hurting yourself. Keep in mind bulkier cars (like Shelbys, or the big bulky muscles in general), deal more ram damage than a 'lighter' speedster of the same class.
 
I have an Xbox one s I've just started playing need for speed hot pursuit remastered I've been trying to beat the ultimate road car for the gold problem is the time is wrong the Lamborghini can not make it with in 3:08:00 because the nitro booster takes too long to boost up and the time is slow so is the car I don't do cheats because this game doesn't have it I've watched videos on YouTube and it shows people beating it I've took every shortcut that there is and it still didn't help it made the Time go faster than before this game need for speed hot pursuit remastered needs to be fix right y'all need to add cheats to so people can beat the game add cheats like unlimited nitro booster unlimited cars unlimited emps and spikes strips and everything else unlimited same with the bounty unlimited.. please fix need for speed hot pursuit remastered for Xbox one s.

@Rebel191979The awe inspired time 2:37:00 is wrong I have hit every shortcut that there is and still get there at 2:38:55 to 2:50:00 I have tried it 25 time's and the 2:37:00 is wrong and I was using nitro booster every time it builds up I was using it. So the car is slow or the time goes way to fast. It needs to be fix also. Make the car faster or slow down the timer. Thanks have a good weekend..
 
1st. The Ultimate Road Car is a preview event in which you drive a McLaren F1, not a Lamborghini. 
2nd. It probably has something to do with your driving in-game because even though I am an average driver, I still manages to achieve under 3:08:00 (2:48:41).
