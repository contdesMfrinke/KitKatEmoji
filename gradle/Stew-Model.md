I tried to make this system something that modeled the actual symptoms of sickness and getting over it, not the sort of thing that penalized attributes at their source or was a list of very rare diseases. I also tried to make it work in the system you are playing in right now by providing multiple options. Sickness in the real world is something that knocks you out but good, but then you get over it. This I know from my personal experiences of the last week or so. Imagine that applied to people leading much higher stress lives.
 
As a regular WFRP GM I can tell you that characters in the Old World do get infected with illness & disease on occasion, so I really like what you have done here. However, in games where every street corner has a healing temple or apothecary, sickness is usually not much of an issue.

I like those as an expansion for this kind of sickness modelling. It might be too much for most systems, but if you are looking for a very detailed approach, such as the kind you would use in a plague based game or when the PCs contact some very specific type of illness, those would be a great place to go.

Our traditional thinking of a leader is someone who makes things happen. Before the stew is cooked it is in a state of equilibrium. A change has to take place. The change happens with heat and pressure to create a new state of disequilibrium. Things are at a boil and very chaotic. During this period of chaos, things, people, and ingredients will want to revert back to the old safe way. As it cools, a new state of equilibrium is achieved. A change has taken place.

The Stewardship Mapping and Assessment Project (STEW-MAP) is a research methodology and mapping tool developed by the USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station to build partnerships and organize environmental stewards. STEW-MAP currently operates in 15 regions worldwide to collect information about civic groups and organizations doing environmental stewardship and answer the question: who takes care of the local environment?
 
In collaboration with the Minneapolis- St. Paul Urban Long Term Ecological Research Program, STEW-MAP is coming to the Twin Cities! We aim to create a searchable map and publicly- available database of civic organizations caring for trees and forests in the Twin Cities. Together, we can help potential volunteers, public agencies, funders, and other stewards learn about your group's work. In turn, you will be able to learn about other groups doing stewardship work in your region.

The E-model Megaswitch brings out five versatile sounds from combinations of single-coil pickups or humbuckers. It replaces a standard 5-way Strat-style switch, for new wiring options plus coil-tapping, and lets the guitarist combine pickup coils for hum elimination.
 
**Before installing the E-model Megaswitch**
Determine the polarity of each pickup coil, and which wires are connected to each coil:Similar magnet poles repel each other, and opposite poles attract. For a humbucking effect, two coils with opposite polarity must be connected either in parallel or in serial mode. Take the pickup that you want to use in the middle position, and place its top side against the top side of another pickup coil. If their magnet polepieces attract each other, they have opposite polarity. Or you can use the #5127 Polarity Tester to do this without removing the pickups.
 
**E-model Megaswitch tone control wiring tips**
When installing the E-model Megaswitch, you often must rewire the tone circuit. If the instrument will have a single or master tone control, wire the volume and tone pots as shown below.
 
**From the underside of the pickguard, install the switch with the circuit board toward the center of the guitar.** Always mount the Megaswitch with the printed circuit board closest to the pickups and control pots. Insert the wires from the non-printed side of the plate, and solder from the printed side.

Our digital rice & grain multicookers pride themselves on cooking perfectly tender rice and grains, every time. But how is this feat achieved time and time again? The answer is Sensor Logic Technology. Unlike most other traditional digital rice cookers on the market, this smart, revolutionary technology is optimized to automatically sense and control the internal temperature throughout the cooking cycle for unbeatable texture and flavor.
 
One-pot meals and effortlessly prepared dinners have never been easier with Saut-then-Simmer technology, featured on your AROMA Professional digital rice & grain multicooker. Our patented Saut-then-Simmer technology will saut ingredients such as meats, vegetables, aromatics, and grains on high heat, then automatically switch to a low-heat simmer mode once any liquid is added to the inner pot.
 
This unique and innovative cooking technology was specifically designed with preparing Spanish rice, risottos, chili and other stovetop favorites in mind, but the mealtime possibilities are as endless as your imagination is with the Saut-then-Simmer function!
 
With AROMA SmartCarb technology, low-carb yet still deliciously cooked rice has become a reality! Each SmartCarb cooker comes with a revolutionary carb-reducing inner pot, much different from your regular, traditional nonstick inner pot.
 
Rice naturally sheds some of its starchy layers during the soaking and cooking process; these layers will then be released back into the liquid that your rice is soaking in. As your rice continues to cook in traditional inner pots, it will steadily reabsorb this starchy water making it packed with excess carbohydrates.
 
While a standard U.S. cup measure is 240 milliliters, a rice measuring cup according to rice industry standards is much smaller at 180 milliliters. All of our models come with a complimentary rice measuring cup and should be used when measuring ingredients in your rice cooker or multicooker. **Our product manuals will always provide cooking guides and charts based on rice measuring cup measurements.**
 
We recommend rinsing rice under cool water before beginning to cook it. Rinsing makes a difference in results, especially with long-grain varieties, because it removes the surface starch that otherwise causes the rice to clump together or become gummy as it cooks. This short added step will be the difference in a good pot of rice and a great one!
 
Brown rice is a less-processed form of rice, which means the grains still have the outer layer of bran on them. These bran layers are removed from white rice, effectively lessening its cook time compared to brown rice. In order to effectively cook brown rice and break down its extra layers, it requires more soaking time in the cooking process.
 
The Delay Timer is a feature that can be used for prepping meals hours in advance or overnight so that you can have dishes ready right when you need them! Most of our digital models offer a 15-Hour Delay Timer, meaning you can place your ingredients in t
