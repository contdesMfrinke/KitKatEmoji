Aluminum Tube has further grown in popularity due to its environmental benefits. Not only is this system 99% recyclable, but it conducts less electricity per uses than the average non-recyclable structure.
 
This system is highly reusable, with easy disassembly and variability of connector-and-frame combinations. Help minimize material waste through exploring the possibility of this Aluminum Tube reorganization or expansion.
 
A key feature of this system is its 3 frame sizes, which allow for accurate connection, despite differences in external frame dimension. Without a need for specialized tools or devices, Aluminum Tube is designed for effortless customization.

For the convenience of our multisystem operators, Aluminum Tube can be integrated with EZ Build for additional versatility. Partner with our team of designers and discover the many possibilities of lean performance with our AL System.
 
Back in September last year, I unfortunately crashed my DS. Since then, I was able to track down a NOS bonnet, some good used bumpers and other parts and strip the rear of the car. The cars paint was faded so instead of having the repairers match faded paint, I will pay extra to repaint the whole car. My current plan is to change the colour of the car from Rouge De Rio (Rio Red), a 1971 colour to Rouge Cornaline, which was offered in 1969 and other years. The Rio red is almost and orangey red and I prefer something with a bit more depth. A red option was not offered in 1970 except for Bordeaux which is a deep brown/red.
 
Last week the repair process began and they have already made good progress. On disassembly there was some damage to the chassis, and you could see where a previous repair had been done. (I had a photo of the car with damage to that side of the car from some years ago). This is now being repaired properly and then the new parts I found will be put on the car.
