I have search and search and can not find anyone selling a repair manual for a singer 153W. I do not want a parts manual or a general setup and service manual. I am looking for a repair manual that will describe had to remove parts and the order they go back. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 
I'm not familiar with any repair manuals, there are just parts manuals and user guides. There are also troubleshooting pages sometime at the back of the user guide "Instructions for Adjusters and Machinists" that go over how to recognize and fix common issues like replacing the internal belt and adjusting the timing, setting the needle bar, ect. If your planning to take the machine totally apart I'm not aware of a compete manual for that level of detail. I think what most of us do is take pictures of each stage as we take parts off, then use those pictures to put it all back once they are clean or replaced.

There really are no repair manuals for most vintage machines, as far as I know. They just assume that's what you learn in your apprenticeship when you become a sewing machine technician. Once you've taken apart a few dozen machines, things will start to look very familiar in other machines.
 
The closest thing to an actual repair manual with removal and re-installation instructions is this Military training manual: TM10-3530-202-24.pdf . It covers repair instructions for variety of machines, including the Singer 111, which shares certain design elements. with your 153.
 
Often you have to get a little creative. In the absence of a manual for a specific machine, documentation for a very close relative can be very useful. In your case of the Singer 153, the Consew 227 is that close relative. Check out the User Manual for the Consew 223/227 (223.pdf). Also, the Consew 227 Parts Manual shows parts in small groups as mini-exploded views where you can tell how things go together, or if something that looks like a screw really is a screw.
 
I repair clocks for a living and leather work is something I have picked up for therapy. I know enough about clocks that I can repair just about anything that is put in front of me, but when it comes to sewing machines I am flying by the seat of my pants. I've always felt if you have not worked on something and there is a manual available then you buy the manual. Thanks for the pdf files.
 
Welcome to the forum! I've been an industrial sewing machine mechanic for 37 years. I use manuals nearly every day. I learned the most from studying parts books in the evening, then studying the machines with the parts books and service manuals. Singer did publish a wide range technical manual for most of their different machine classes all in one 3" thick book. They actually have step by step instructions for several machines. I don't recall if the 153 class is covered, but I'll check. It was printed in the early 70's. Cowboy Bob has probably seen it. The 153's a good machine. I still use 3 for binding. They have some inherent design flaws, but I've never seen a machine without that didn't.
 
Specific to Consew industrial machines but will help identify walking foot and sewing problems generally. Impressive trouble-shooting section and a chapter on servicing clutch motors, common to many industrials. Included as typical of some of the excellent publications, helpfully posted online by diligent manufacturers. Google and ye shall find.
 
A stunningly good repair manual. Tools for Self-Reliance is a charity that sends, amongst other things, sustainable sewing machines (common Singers) to the third world. They need donated machines to work and have produced these instructions, downloadable free online, to help generous members of the public service their donations. Extremely thorough and profusely illustrated with CLEAR photos of virtually every moving part, plus tensions, timings, case refurbishment, etc. Excellent!

Written for use in the garment trade. An extensive troubleshooting guide with sufficient instructions to help operators maintain their machines. Generic information but clearly presented and illustrated.
 
A useful list; 80 pages, comprising hundreds of (largely) American, domestic machines and their corresponding Singer needles. Canadian and a few British manufacturers are also included. Photographs of the needles to help I.D. **The entries for Wanzer machines should be viewed with suspicion.**
 
A thorough, concise and copiously illustrated (B&W line drawings) analysis of the principal domestic machine types; from the vibrating shuttle (Singer VS2, 27 etc.) onwards. Zigzag, too. Comprehensive instructions for the diagnosis, dismantling and repair of pre-1958 machines. Older models with a transverse shuttle, or producing a chain stitch, are not covered. Chapters also on S.M. motors/controllers; relevant tools; equipping and adapting a repair workbench - with a built-in treadle!
 
Simple machine maintenance, quickly and straightforwardly explained. Produced during WWII to encourage the Home Front to make do and mend. A slight publication but a good place to start. Useful illustrated interchangeable needle list for American machines.
 
A comprehensive cross-referenced listing of Singer attachments and Fashion Aids, cross-referenced to the machines they once accompanied. Includes details of (nearly) all the extra attachments, Fashion Aids, puzzle boxes, oil cans, literature, furniture and loads more. Plenty of crisp photography and neat snippets of model information. Currently in print (2010).
 
Densely packed and clearly illustrated information on fixing a wide variety of pre-1920 machines; including transverse (boat-shaped) shuttle models, chain-stitchers and some industrials. Possibly the best of the repair manuals for earlier machines.
 
Pretty much everything you need to service a wide variety of American and Japanese, post-WW2, domestic zigzag machines. Copious illustrations and directions but, as genuine copies currently fetch more than the cost of a professional overhaul, DIY may prove a false economy.

My home page is dedicated to my Mother & Father who put up with my "fixing" everything in sight. My wife, Linda, who has supported me in every way. Larry Baird, the local banker, who personally loaned me $500.00 when I didn't have the down payment the bank required to purchase the store. Alfred "Rosie" Cler, the businessman who filled my store with merchandise, with a Â“handshakeÂ” as our only contract for payment. Willard Martin, the local antique dealer, who provided encouragement & advice.To these special people, I am forever grateful.
 
How did I learn to repair sewing machines? First, as a teenager, I made rules to follow when making repairs on anything. Later, I attended every sewing machine repair course made available to me by the big name sewing machine distributors.
 
In October 2002 I opened the first professional manufacturer type "hands on" sewing machine repair classes ever offered to the general public. Since then, it has grown to include travel and make training available to people in several different States. It has been very rewarding to see people become empowered to repair their own machines or open a successful new business.
