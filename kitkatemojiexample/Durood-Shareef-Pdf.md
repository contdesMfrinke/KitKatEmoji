Hadrat Sheikh Yusuf Bin Ismail (radi Allahu anhu) says that this Durood Shareef is the greatest mystery of Allah. It brings 100% success and happiness to the reciter. In fact, this Durood Shareef brings prosperity and favour and solves all the complex problems by the Grace of Allah. When a man recites this Durood Shareef, the Angels of Allah surround him, mercy covers him and peace starts descending on him.

This Durood Shareef is of a very great value. If it is recited only once, it amounts to all the rewards of all the Duroods. By reciting this Durood, one gets peace of mind and success in this world as well as in the next. After reciting this Durood Shareef, the reciter can claim that he has recited almost all the Duroods which are in this world known to the people. During days of upheavals, this Durood Shareef brings relief, success and true happiness. It is mostly the Saints and very pious people who recite this Durood after every prayer. They also recommended this Durood Shareef to all the needy.
 
This Durood Shareef is always a cure for all calamities in the world of worldly affairs. It was taught by Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) himself. To recite this Durood Shareef 70 times during days of calamity, turmoil and trouble, is a must. It works wonders.
 
This Durood Shareef is a very sacred one. If it is recited after every prayer, it is said that the reciter will receive the Sawaab equivalent to the recital of the entire Holy Quran. After reading the verses of the Holy Quran, this Durood Shareef should be recited 3 times.
.
 
Hadrat Abu Hurairah (radi Allahu anhu), a close companion of Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam), has said that if a person recites this Durood eighty times on Friday (after evening prayers), then his sins equivalent to 80 years will be forgiven.
 
Hadrat Zarar bin Auzar (radi Allahu anhu), another companion of the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) says that he used to recite this Durood Shareef and fight with the non-believers. In every battle, he saw that success kissed his feet, and he never lost any battle on any day.

May allah(swt) peace be upon the Prophet(pbuh) his family and all his companion. i have recited many Daroods during 15 years and got a large number of reward in life, no dought , that any Darood said by any companion of Muhammad (pbuh) has truth on 110 percent. The greatest achievement during recitation is to see Holly Prophet (pbuh) in dream, that is in my experience. God bless our country and worldwide muslim every where in peace. thanks
