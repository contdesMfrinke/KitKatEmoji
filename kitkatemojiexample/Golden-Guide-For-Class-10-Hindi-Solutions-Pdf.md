Basic national health coverage is administered through local and regional health centers and hospitals in the public healthcare system. These facilities fall under the jurisdiction of five regional health administrations, while the regions of Madeira and the Azores have their own health systems in place. National health coverage is comprehensive, including all medical care apart from dental care costs, and this service is available to all citizens and legal residents of Portugal.

Meanwhile, the Health Regulatory Entity (ERS), an independent regulatory body, oversees public, social, and private healthcare. To access state-provided medical services, you must register with your local council (junta de freguesia) to ensure your entitlement.
 
With most private health insurance, physicians from your health center would cover you for pharmaceutical products, diagnostic technologies, and private practice. Of course, the medical care included in the plan will depend on the insurance company from which you opt to buy coverage.
 
Applicants of the **Portugal Golden Visa scheme** who travel to Portugal before obtaining the Golden Visa must purchase private health insurance and travel insurance from their country of origin. **Travel insurance** documents should state that coverage is valid and renewable in Portugal.
 
Once applicants receive their Portugal Golden Visa, they are eligible for the Portugal National Health Service (SNS). However, they must first register with the SNS to benefit from its services. Note that dental costs are not covered.
 
**The D7 Visa** requires applicants to purchase travel insurance in their home country, which provides health coverage for one year. Proof of this coverage will be requested along with other required documents when applying for the D7 Visa. The same is also needed for the Entrepreneurship Visa.
 
If the initial application is approved in your country of origin, a four-month visa for Portugal will be issued to applicants. Applicants must present themselves to the Portuguese Agency for Integration, Migration, and Asylum (AIMA) within this period. Their travel insurance will cover applicants until the D7 residence permit is formally issued. Following a successful appointment with AIMA, the applicant will be granted a D7 residence permit (lasting two years).
 
Once the applicant receives the D7 Residence Permit, they can access public healthcare. Register with SNS to access your local health center, healthcare services and their benefits. D7 Visa holders can also purchase private health insurance.

Private doctors and healthcare facilities are widely available through private health insurance. Improvements to the healthcare system were made by introducing public-private partnerships for new hospitals, changing hospital management structures, pharmaceutical reforms, reorganizing primary care, and creating long-term care networks.
 
In Portugal, private healthcare costs are relatively low compared to numerous other nations, and private insurance allows you to get an appointment more quickly than the public healthcare system. You can also be assured that virtually all doctors in the private healthcare system speak English.
 
Medical emergency care is free, but all other services incur a fee, sometimes due immediately, this may apply to consultations, medical emergency room visits, and ambulance services. Everyone can receive hospital care at a local health center, but you will be charged if the Portuguese national health services, reciprocal healthcare agreements, or private health insurance do not cover you. In some cases, private healthcare systems offer a more seamless process.
 
Suppose you are not a permanent resident but have been in Portugal for at least 90 days. In that case, you can obtain a document stating this from the local **Junta de Freguesia** and use this document, a photo ID, IRS number, and a proof of address to obtain a Numero de Utente, which allows access to the Portuguese national health services at a discount.
 
Government-funded subsystems cover public employees. Private subsystems, similar to employer-provided health insurance, are available for employees of companies such as banks and larger corporations. However, this type of coverage is uncommon, and most pay for private health insurance.
 
Those living and working in Portugal who are not covered by reciprocal healthcare agreements with their home countries have two options for medical care. Legal residents can either pay into the social security system, which is incremental to income or opt for one of the many private healthcare insurance plans.
 
Pharmacies, known in Portuguese as farmcias, are widely distributed throughout Portugal. Many medicines, including over-the-counter medication, are subsidized if obtained with a prescription, which makes them very cost-effective.
 
Portugal has a history of positively dealing with immigrants in terms of healthcare, and many medical professionals are sensitive to language barriers. Virtually all doctors in the public and private systems speak English.
 
Hospitals, health centers, and clinics all deliver Portuguese healthcare services for women. The Portuguese health system covers maternity and childcare services, and expectant mothers generally receive care at a public hospital close to home. Private medical care is also an option if the expectant mother has health insurance.
 
Prenatal care takes place at the hospital. During the initial appointment, the mother-to-be receives a pregnancy booklet, and her doctor will record the ongoing medical information as the pregnancy progresses. Maternity wards offer prenatal classes, although they are not generally subsidized through public health insurance. Midwives are on hand to help with the birth.
 
Children receive free healthcare in Portugal. They have regular health checks from birth and can access services such as screenings, examinations, vaccinations, and nutritional healthcare. They will also have a record that charts their progress. In Portugal, primary care doctors and pediatricians are responsible for medical care for children.
 
Portugal also has a system to help children under six who lag in development, called the Sistema Nacional de Interverno Precoce na Infncia (SNIPI). The SNIPI has units in all areas of Portugal, and it employs the following specialists: nurses, social workers, educators, speech therapists, and physiotherapists.
 
Mental healthcare services in Portugal are provided through mental health teams that work in hospitals and health centers. Studies have shown that **around one in five Portuguese people have experienced mental health problems**. While mental health and substance abuse are issues in Portugal, the mental healthcare system and the provision of mental healthcare are not as developed as in many other countries. Consequently, there is a shortage of mental health specialists relative to the Portuguese population. There are only **12.4 psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants**, less than the EU average in Portugal.

The system ranks higher than the UK, Ireland, Spain, and Italy in terms of patient rights, accessibility, information, waiting times, and overall health outcomes. In some cases, as with many healthcare systems, the public system may have longer waiting lists than private healthcare.
 
If you are a resident of Portugal, then you will have access to the *Servio Nacional de Sade*(SNS) and will only have to pay a small fee. Compared to many other countries in Western Europe, the Portuguese healthcare system is considered very affordable and of a high standard. Private medical insurance is also an option, where you will have access to private hospitals.
