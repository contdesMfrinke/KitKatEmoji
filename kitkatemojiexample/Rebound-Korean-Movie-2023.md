Alumnus Kang Yang-hyeon, who had been on the coaching staff of the U-16 boys' national team,[6] is brought in as the new head coach, but his appointment sparks many players to walk out as they refuse to play under a still-relatively unknown coach. After some convincing, Coach Kang manages to scrape together a ragtag team of six players, most of whom were rejected by other top basketball schools, for the upcoming National Basketball Championships. He tries to engrain in them the mindset of teamwork and not wasting any loose balls, as summarized by his motto: "There is no such thing as missed shots, only rebounds!"

The premise of the plot was the 2012 edition of the National Basketball Championships, an annual high school tournament run by the Korea Secondary Schools Basketball Federation.[14] Once a renowned basketball school, Jungang High School had been on the verge of shutting down the basketball program after years of poor performance and stagnation, a stark contrast to their opponents in the final, Seoul powerhouses Yongsan High School.[2] Despite losing to a Heo Hoon-inspired Yongsan High School, the Jungang High School team was given a standing ovation by the spectators and their story quickly caught the attention of the media.[15][16] Jungang High School's captain Cheon Ki-beom went on to play for Yonsei University and Seoul Samsung Thunders.
 
The story came to the attention of the production team of BA Entertainment, best known for the *Crime City* film series, but plans for a film adaptation remained in development hell for a decade. Kim Eun-hee joined hands with screenwriter Kwon Sung-hui, to write a script for the film.[17]
 
In February 2022, the casting was finalized and principal photography began the following month. Ahn Jae-hong was cast as coach Kang Yang-hyeon. Lee Shin-young, Jeong Jin-woon, Jung Gun-joo, Ahn Ji-ho, Kim Taek, and Kim Min portrayed the Jungang High School players.[18]
 
The actors portraying Kang and the Jungang High School players spent several months learning to play basketball and filmed on location at the school's basketball court.[19][20] The production notably received support from the Korean Basketball League and the domestic basketball community. The KBL allowed its referees to serve as technical consultants and portray the referees and match officials. Former men's national team coach Cho Sang-hyun oversaw the auditions for extras to portray players from the opposing teams. Jo Hyun-il, one of the two narrators, is a veteran basketball commentator.[21]
 
The film was released on April 5, 2023 in South Korea and was pre-sold in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore. It was officially invited to the 25th Udine Far East Film Festival, which was held from April 21 to 29,[24] where it won second place at podium alongside *Abang Adik* of Malaysia.[25]
 
Jeon Hyung-hwa, writing for *Ilgan Sports*, called the film a "precious, fun and passionate second chance." Praising Ahn Jae-hong's performance as coach Kang Yang-hyun, he concluded, "*Rebound* has no enemies, as there are opponents, but not enemies." He added, "If it had been a movie where winning or losing was important, it would have fleshed out an enemy, in which case it would have been punchier, but this movie chose [to highlight] the process, not victory or defeat."[29]
 
The film received praise for its realism as a sports-centered biopic.[30] Retired player Ha Seung-jin praised the attention to detail, especially in scenes of the tournament games, and noted that it never came across as awkward, even to a former professional basketball player like himself.[19]

Rebound pain after regional anesthesia can be defined as transient acute postoperative pain that ensues following resolution of sensory blockade, and is clinically significant, either with regard to the intensity of pain or the impact on psychological well-being, quality of recovery, and activities of daily living. Current evidence suggests that it represents an unmasking of the expected nociceptive response in the absence of adequate systemic analgesia, rather than an exaggerated hyperalgesic phenomenon induced by local anesthetic neural blockade. In the majority of patients, it does not appear to significantly impact cumulative postoperative opioid consumption, quality of recovery, or patient satisfaction, and is not associated with longer-term sequelae such as persistent post-surgical pain. Nevertheless, it must be considered whenever regional anesthesia is incorporated into perioperative management. Strategies to mitigate the impact of rebound pain include routine prescribing of a systemic multimodal analgesic regimen, as well as patient education on appropriate expectations regarding block offset and expected surgical pain, and timely initiation of analgesic medication. Prolonging the duration of action of regional anesthesia with continuous catheter techniques or local anesthetic adjuncts may also help alleviate rebound pain, although further research is required to confirm this.
 
Background:  Interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) is a common regional technique to manage acute postoperative pain for arthroscopic rotator cuff tear repair. However, rebound pain may compromise its overall benefit. Our aim was to investigate the primary hypothesis that perineural and intravenous dexamethasone have different effects on rebound pain after resolution of ISB for arthroscopic rotator cuff tear repair.
 
Conclusion:  Although perineural dexamethasone provided longer postoperative analgesia, intravenous dexamethasone was more beneficial in reducing pain increase after ISB resolution, incidence of rebound pain, and pain-related sleep disturbance.

Samsung projected the memory chip market to remain strong in the coming months, driven by the expansion of generative AI technologies, which is increasing the demand for both conventional chips used in servers and advanced chips designed to process AI, including high-bandwidth memory, or HBM.
 
Responding to higher demands for AI chips, Samsung said it started this month the mass production of its latest HBM chips, called 8-layer HBM3E, and that it plans to start producing the 12-layer version of the chips during the second quarter.
 
For smartphones, the company will continue to focus on boosting the sales of its flagship device, Galaxy S24, which is built with an array of new features enabled by AI, including live translation during phone calls in 13 languages and 17 dialects.
 
Samsung said it plans to expand AI features beyond the S24 to other mobile devices as it expects the technologies to drive growth in the smartphone market in coming months amid improvements in global consumer spending.
 
SEOUL, Dec. 15 (Yonhap) -- The South Korean economy continues to show signs of a gradual recovery driven by a rebound in the manufacturing sector, particularly led by chips, the finance ministry said Friday.
 
"Recently, the South Korean economy has been gradually showing signs of a recovery, on the back of improvements in the production and exports of the manufacturing sector, including semiconductors," the Ministry of Economy and Finance said in the report.
 
"Externally, there is a mix of hope over the recovery of the IT industry and the slowing momentum of rebound globally," it added. "The Russia-Ukraine war and instability in the Middle East pose geopolitical risks and may disrupt the supply chain."
 
With the increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide, early adiposity rebound, which is known to have a strong association with obesity, has recently been a focus of research. Early adiposity rebound is conventionally known to have a close relationship with non-communicable diseases. However, novel insights into early adiposity rebound have implied an acceleration of growth and puberty, which is directly reflected in the trends in the timing of adiposity rebound, in the 21st century compared with in the past. Furthermore, the observation that lean mass changes rather than fat mass changes show a more similar pattern to body mass index trajectories is interesting. In this article, the later outcomes and risk factors of early adiposity rebound are briefly summarized, and the current trends in the timing of adiposity rebound and novel insights into its relationship with body composition are reviewed.
