A desser is performing a similar function, like how a side chain works. What ever you are using to record, is most likely spiking in a particular freq. Or, you have a bit of an S when speaking etc. Easy to solve really.

example: 6k to 8k maybe. This is a typical issue created with less quality electronics. Using a parametric to dial in the spike, narrow it in and, pull it out is pretty much the same thing. Since you are only dealing with one voice, yes? 
Cheap dessers are junk IMHO. They degrade the entire sound, not just the spike. If you can't afford something of quality, a parametric on hand may do it for you.
 
**griz wrote:** I'm wondering if there are any standalone software programs that competently de-ess a wav file. I don't want to spend the money for a hardware de-esser when I rarely use need it.
 
I've never tried this, but you could also have a look at the possibility of running a VST de-esser plug in a standalone box such as one of the SM Pro Audio "V" range (V-Machine, V-Box, V-Rack etc). You would need to have a MIDI controller available to control the parameters. Not as cheap as free software, but would get you out of having to run DAW programs.
 
I know this is a bit old, and this has been covered before, and it's not exactly what you were asking, but....wait, why am I posting this?
The Massey de-esser is pretty amazing. I'll agree that most plugin de-essers aren't very good. Even the Waves de-esser isn't all that great (in my opinion). The Massey one is free to try (just can't save presets), and very cheap, if you do buy it. One of my top 5 plugins.
 
T-De-Esser 2 is an intuitive and user-friendly De-Esser plugin designed to smooth out high frequencies while preserving a natural and musical sound. It is significantly improves upon the T-De-Esser MK1 in terms of both functionality and audio performance.

T-De-Esser 2 can streamline your audio project workflow by saving you both vital time and effort. It works as effectively on individual tracks as it does on buses. It performs admirably in a wide range of implementations, from sound design and post-production to the most demanding of mastering applications.
 
Unlike the majority of De-Esser plug-ins available on the market, T-De-Esser 2 gives a pure natural sound while smoothing the high-frequencies.  
  
The only noticeable difference will be the removal of harshness.
 
Visuals can distract your hearing, digital graphs are very likely to affect your decision-making when it comes to setting the values. T-De-Esser 2, however, helps you just stay focused on the output sound, rather than how things change visually as you tweak the settings.
 
Whilst there are only a few knobs and buttons on the GUI, each has a huge impact on the audio sound improvement. Less is more, so just to avoid getting caught in the trap of making infinite, minuscule tweaks, we made sure only to have the essential options available for you on the GUI.
 
The plug-in features a dedicated bypass/on control, which allows for the swift enabling or bypassing of the effect. This user-friendly control is designed to help avoid potential clicks or audio artefacts that may occur when toggling the effect on or off directly within the DAW host.
 
The interface scaling feature in T-De-Esser 2 allows you to customise the size of the GUI to suit your preferences and optimise your workflow. With a range of scaling options available, from 50% to 150%, you can personalise the interface to match your visual and working style.
 
T-De-Esser 2 comes with the handy feature of built-in 'Undo' and 'Redo' options, providing added peace of mind while working on your audio processing. With these functions, you can easily revert to previous settings or redo changes that were made in error, saving time and eliminating the stress of potentially losing valuable adjustments.
 
"T-De-Essr is super fresh and funky! I love the 4 buttons at the bottom right. It makes things fast as you can just dive in and get exactly what you need. It's creativity and utility. I see it as a tool for both. Super utilitarian tool and also can be a very creative one. It's a great plugin!"
 
"One of the cleanest, simplest and most successful plugins I've ever seen! the reduction is very good and at the same time very smooth, it doesn't lose the quality of the vocals, and it's even possible to change which frequencies you want it to reduce... I'll definitely use it very often"
 
The most common usage for de-essers is for fixing sibilance issues on vocal recordings, however, as the T-De-Esser 2 works in a different way than regular types of de-essers, it can be useful for several kinds of sound sources, such as drums, guitars, keys, etc.
 
We recommend using the T-De-Esser 2 as the first instance of your plug-ins chain. However, sometimes it is also ideal to use it after EQ or use a second instance of T-De-Esser 2 after EQ. For example, you may want to fix some harshness and sibilance issues of a recording using a first T-De-Esser 2 instance, then boost more high-end frequencies using an EQ to brighten up the sound and use a second T-De-Esser 2 in the chain to smooth out the boosted high-end.
 
Of course. We allow users to take advantage of our free T-De-Esser 2 plug-in for their audio projects, whether it's personal or commercial audio projects. However, we do not permit third parties to upload/share or sell our plug-in installers. Please our terms and conditions for more information on this.

Surgical Mastering Equalizers, also known as EQs, are an irreplaceable tool for any music producer during the mastering process. Surgical mastering EQs provide precision and control, essential to achieving a high-quality mix.
 
One of the main benefits of using surgical mastering EQs is their ability to fix problematic resonance frequencies. These frequencies can cause a mix to sound muddy, boomy, thin, or toppy. Using surgical mastering EQs, you can remove rumble from low frequencies and tighten the bass, positively affecting the mix. You can create defined bass sounds and punchy kick drums crucial to a great mix.
 
Another critical feature of surgical mastering EQs is their ability to improve the width and add rich, airy highs. This is achieved using M/S technology, which allows you to work separately on the mid and side channels. This will enable you to improve the stereo image and bring out details in the mix.
 
Linear phase EQs are a type of surgical mastering EQ that offers high transparency and is ideal for fixing problematic resonance frequencies. They allow you to make precise and accurate frequency adjustments without introducing unwanted artefacts.
 
Mastering a song with a compressor is crucial in achieving a polished, professional-sounding recording. When mastering music, starting with the best mix is essential. This will ensure that the compressor works from a solid foundation rather than trying to fix problems that should have been addressed during the mixing process.
 
Also, try parallel compression to add depth and character to your mix. This technique involves running a copy of the mix through the compressor. This compressed copy is mixed with the original mix to add thickness and glue to the overall sound.
 
You can use high-end mastering compressor plug-ins explicitly designed for mastering, such as those in the list below. These plug-ins will have a more transparent sound and will be able to sweeten the mix without introducing unwanted artefacts.
 
Mastering engineers can significantly benefit from using analogue-emulated equalizer plug-ins, which produce warm high-quality sound. These plug-ins are specifically designed to replicate the unique characteristics of classic analogue equalizers commonly used to shape the sound of recordings.
 
One of the main benefits of using analogue emulation colouring mastering equalizers is that they can add warmth and character to a mix. These plug-ins can create a smooth and natural sound by boosting the high frequencies and providing a more defined bass. They can also give your songs a punchier and more dynamic sound by boosting or cutting specific frequencies.
