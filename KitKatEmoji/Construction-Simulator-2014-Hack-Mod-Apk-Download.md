Construction Simulator: Gold Edition is a simulation game where players take control of all types of construction equipment including bulldozers, cranes, excavators, road pavers, trucks and many more. Construction Simulator: Gold Edition was developed by weltenbauer Software Entwicklung GmbH and published by astragon Entertainment.
 
Construction Simulator: Gold Edition is available for PC through Steam as well as for the XBox one, XBox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. The PC version of the game sells for $44.99 while the console versions are $49.99. The original game is also now available for free for PlayStation Plus Premium or PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers within their Game Catalog!
 
There are over 200 construction jobs available between the three different maps, providing more than 150 hours of playtime. Construction Simulator: Gold Edition has more than 100 officially licensed vehicles, machines and equipment from 28 world-renowned brands and manufacturers as well as cooperative multiplayer for up to 4 players.

The campaign contracts really add a lot to Construction Simulator: Gold Edition. As you complete the individual jobs, you build up a part of the city or facility. Once you have finished one job, you then unlock the next job and by the end can take pride in your work and how it has made an improvement to the map. Players can also choose to take individual jobs such as repairing a road or constructing a house for some extra money and to get practice on small tasks before taking on the larger jobs. The game also includes a reward system that unlocks new features for your company and its home base. For example, as you refuel and repair your equipment at the gas station, eventually you can unlock fueling and repair features at your home base. By completing jobs and earning money, banks will offer you loans so you can purchase some of that expensive equipment before you have enough money in your account.
 
Cat Simulators teach the same applications as found on real-world construction sites. Using correct operational techniques increases safety and production. Cat Simulators are the only Caterpillar-licensed simulators on the market.
 
Filled with excavators, cranes and more, the Construction Simulator series was originally created in 2011 by German game publisher Astragon Entertainment and software firm Weltenbauer and has since spawned several mobile iterations.
 
**REN NOLD:**Weltenbauer was not originally set in a game development environment. We were doing more B2B jobs and also real time applications and simulation stuff, but not focused on games. In 2011, one of the Astragon [employees] got to know one of our Weltenbauer staff. Astragon came up with the idea of developing some kind of construction-related simulation game.
 
So we started to implement the first installment, which was Construction Simulator 2012. It was for PC only and very small. But it had a bunch of vehicles, around 14, and 11 missions, which had to be played in a straight line. So not really an open world game.
 
**NOLD:**Simulation [games] are niche, but it's a growing niche. Similar to Euro Truck Simulator and Farming Simulator, the Construction Simulator is also very calm gameplay. It's not as fast, of course, as a first-person shooter or a racing game or something like that. It's another kind of relaxation.
 
**CARSTEN HӦH:**I would say for sure that we have a range of players starting at six years old, and it goes up to 70-year-old players. Actually, from the young ones, there is a huge number that are playing these games because they like the huge machines. We don't have handwork or manual work in the game, but when it comes to the machines, these are two of the first steps into something big like this.
 
**NOLD:**Yeah, it's like the digital equivalent of playing in the sandbox with a scale model of an excavator or something. If you're aged like, as Carsten said, seven, eight years old or something like that you're still addicted to this construction topic.
 
You're able to learn how these guys operate the real-world machines on your PC or on your console and how to operate an excavator, and which stick and which axis is turning the bucket, the first arm and second arm.
 
The ability to effectively visualize the construction process and make important decisions about resource utilization, sequencing, site layout, and project-related risks are critical skills for design and construction engineering students. The increase in complexity of projects and shorter schedules pose pressure to develop more efficient construction methods, and also many challenges to educators to prepare students to manage these m
