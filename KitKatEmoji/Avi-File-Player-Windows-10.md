I want itunes to be the default media player for all files it supports, I tried some of the suggestions posted but they don't work inn W10, Microsoft isn't going to make it easy for anyone to chose apps other than theirs but I mostly hate the windows apps and all of my media is either itunes or Amazon so itunes. itunes isn't an available option in ay of the drop down menus when selecting default apps by file type, which makes it nearly impossible to choose it as default. 'warn me when itunes is not my default" has always been checked but I've never seen a warning.

Ever since getting version 5 of Malwarebytes on my Windows 11 system, Windows Media Player Legacy (v12) won't play .mp3, mp4 or other any media files.
I eventually get "not responding" in the media player, and also get one or both of the following errors ... "The RPC server is unavailable / The remote procedure call failed"
 
RPC services are running, and I've tried all suggested built in Windows troubleshooters, removed and re-adding media player
The new media player works, as does VLC, but I'm one of many that prefer the old WMP
 
I did try turning off the individual protection settings and also all of them at once which helped at first, but after a couple of successful views, problem came back.
I just tried turning off Malware & Pup protection by itself, same thing, worked a couple of times and problem came back
I also cleared any settings in WMP that might connect to the internet, even disable network adapters with no change
 
**The fix may possibly take up to 60 minutes to complete**

If the tool needs a restart please make sure you let the system restart normally and let the tool complete its run after restart.
The tool will make a log named **Fixlog.txt** in the same folder you ran the **Farbar** program from. Please attach that log on your next reply.

I have installed Xibo 1.7.7 player in Windows 10 PC and it works fine except from the fact that when I close it, it auto restarts after a few seconds so I had to uninstall it in order to be able to work. I have found settings to disable auto restart but there are only for Android profiles. How can I disable auto restart in Windows?
 
Find and highlight the XIBO application by clicking it. Then click DISABLE bottom right. Next time you restart the PC the watchdog application will not start but you do not have to rename anything nor uninstall it. This applies to any start-up application by the way.

Apologies. I note earlier this refers to 1.7.8. The version I use (1.7.6) obviously does not have this functionality. I would like to see the installer differentiate between a system used for development and one used to play the presentation. This could stop both this problem and the XIBO player auto start-up problem.
 
But I do love the software, with all its quirks, and have it running on 5 displays in a fish and chip shop without any problems (other than Win10 keep wanting to update itself even though I have told it not to).
 
Also, John is actually correct (I just tested it). The Windows 10 Task Manager groups tasks by vendor, so when startup is disabled for Xibo, it is disabled for both the Player AND the Watch Dog process, creating the effect the original poster was after.
 
I want to use WMP to listen to music, but at the same time I'm sorting out some videos etc that I want to quickly preview in WMP. Is it possible to open another 'instance' of WMP without cutting off my music?
 
Next, double click and open whatever videos you want normally, the new instance should open up in your user. If it tries opening with the first instance then do the same - right click, do "run as different user" and choose your own.
 
If however this does not work, I **highly** recommend you look at VLC, I use it for opening multiple videos at once in order to compare them, through one setting, it has no problem in opening up as many copies as you want.
 
Sandboxie is free and works with all 32-bit versions of Windows. however, if you want to create multiple containers, you'll have to register the software, in return you'll get lifetime upgrades and you may install Sandboxie with your registration code on any computer you own.
 
Funnily enough, I randomly discovered you can do what I wanted to do in Windows 7 using Windows Explorer and the built-in Windows Media Player support for the 'Preview' pane. The media player in the preview pane is very clunky but, yes, you can select some music, hit play and load other things in another Media Player window.
 
This is media player classic, basically continued 3rd party support for the classic video player. They have both 32 and 64 bit versions for win7 or vista. I loaded it and clicked on two different video files and they both opened in their own window. Both files played at the same time as well. I have Windows 7 ult 64 and was annoyed at the lack of ability of the built in player. You would think that would be a given considering most computers today May 2010 are dual core or better.
 
You haven't been far enough...Play some music with WMP12.Then open explorer with the preview pane... Preview a video or some music and see that button next to the play button in the preview pane? Hit it and what a miracle a 2nd WMP12 open ;)
 
After some struggling (and plenty of the help from the community, especially @@Luke and @@funwithmedia), I have managed to get VLC launching correctly as an external player. I thought I would share the steps I used to enable it for anyone else who may need some assistance in getting it working.
 
For step 9, there are all kinds of command line arguments you can enter to control how VLC launches. I hope to add some of these to this post later. If anyone else has a list they would like to add please feel free.
 
Firstly I was trying to run the videos direct from media theater direct on my Windows 7 PC I have. The majority of films run fine apart from those marked as HEVC codec. These lag considerably picture wise but the audio is fine.
 
I was therefore advised to use an external player instead. I reinstalled VLC player and that log error has gone....I'm launching content from Emby in VLC...but the HEVC just plays a black screen and I have audio still. Just can't get my head around why my PC is having such issues playing content.
 
When you say you are trying to play the files on your Windows 7 PC, is that the same PC where you have Emby Server set up? Or do you have Emby Server running on a different machine? If it is on a different machine, what type of connection do you have to it?
 
For the HEVC files, are they HEVCx264 or HEVCx265? It is possible that if they are x265 that your video card doesn't support them. Have you tried opening any of them in VLC without using Emby? It's my understanding that Emby is really just pointing VLC to where the file resides, but I would still try this just to rule out any issues with Emby.
 
Agreed. And VLC doesn't use directshow codecs, so if you have your codecs properly configured to play MKV and other files you lose that benefit as well. De-interlacing of DVD video doesn't seem to be something VLC does either. VLC may still play them, but my experience has been it doesn't do as well.
 
I disagree. VLC appears (at least in my experience) to do a much better job of down-mixing 5.1 or 7.1 to stereo. I also find that the picture is a little more crisp than playing back in Emby Theatre. I can't say I notice that big of a difference in the video quality, but the difference in audio quality is huge.
 
I've been a huge fan of VLC for years (my own, custom-coded HTPC setup of many years was built around it). But I'm very curious to see how MPV ( -theater-mpv-test/) compares, and @@Natilus13 you might want to have a look at that thread as well (and probably best to post comments regarding VLC vs MPV comparisons there). I also wonder (though I've not had an opportunity to test this) if the addition of MPV to Emby Theater will negate (at least somewhat) the need for External Players for DVD folder playing (when direct playing at least -- if transcoding is needed that obviously will not work with DVD menus).
 
This was discussed in other posts. The two main things were the picture quality being more crisp on VLC, and VLC doing a better job of downmixing surround to stereo. It's possible these have improved with Emby. I haven't tried using the internal player since this post was created.
