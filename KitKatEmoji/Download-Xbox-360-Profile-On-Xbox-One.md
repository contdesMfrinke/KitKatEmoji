Today I decided to unlink my Xbox profile from account B and link it to my main account, account A, because I wanted to have everything in one place. But after this, on my Xbox I have a new, empty soldier. I lost my all progress. Why? I thought this process will just move my Xbox soldier to new EA account. I screwed this up? :/ I want my old soldier back

After over a month of writing with support via e-mail, nothing has been done, because waiting for a reply is 3 days of waiting and I had to give them the verification code several times, to confirm that I am aware of what disconnects my EA account from my Xbox account means. This is partly my fault because I did not write with support from the account that was currently associated with the Xbox account.
Anyway, from the e-mail conversation it appeared that:
1. They can't link my old EA account to my Xbox account, but they can help me disconnect those accounts.
2. After reconnect the first EA account that had progress with my Xbox account, the progress will be back.

Yesterday I decided to speed up the procedure as I didn't have an email reply for several days. I asked a live chat consultant to disconnect my accounts. He did it, but said that if I will link my old account back, the progress wouldn't come back. Nevertheless, I tried and it turned out that the progress was preserved. Everything ended well.

After that, I told EA advisor that the progress was not removed and he said the progress is usually lost.

Fortunately for me, it was not like that.
 
**Ask the live chat customer support to unlink the new account from your xbox account, and then manually link your xbox account to the old EA account (we did it through the xbox PC app to EA desktop app), and the progress will return!**
 
So as of now, if you're a streamer who uses multiple PSN ID's or XBox One Accounts, for whatever reason (Mine being my wife and I both play, and would both like to stream solo when the other isnt there, on our sites stream), you must jump through hoops to do so.
 
The only other alternative is for the individual streamer to go drop $1000+ on a capture card, and streaming capable PC, which not a solution, at least not a realistic one for many of us, otherwise we'd just be PC Streamers.
 
This. I have two accounts. An old PSN that I used as a kid and a newer one. The old one I couldnt play Overwatch on, and now I have too much items on the new one to play the older even if I could. Too many skins that OW2 makes you pay $20+ for with no way to earn them. On the new PSN I cant get MC to work. So when I stream, I have to split my attention between the two. I cannot stream the two games on the same day since I have to mess with sign out and linking. I also have to remember to swap them if I plan to stream one or the other the next day. Im worried one of these days the swapping will get flagged as suspicious activity and lock me out of my own account.

While that is what is needed to take place in order to stream from the other account. There are times from my Ps4 days that after disconnecting one account, and trying to relink the other it would fail. Granted this has been a little over 1 year now since I last streamed from a console.
 
However as there is an option to link other accounts to a Twitch account, why not intergrade an option that asks which platform you are streaming from. Then at this point the studio will give the person the ability to add other profiles from the system/console \*giving the option like WoW so to speak with character selection screen& with that platform, grouping them as a "team" so to speak. To which each account that run from the same platform, would be grouped together. Granting streaming privilege's to nearby friendly mobs.
 
So I was just able to sync multiple accounts on my PS4 to my twitch account. When I go to one or the other they both come up with the same broadcasting screen with the same stream title. Tested it by switching profiles and starting a stream while viewing my channel. I disconnected my alt account from my alt PS4 profile then broadcasted it and when it prompted me to activate I went on the website, without being logged into my main Twitch account, activated and then logged into my main account an poof, it worked. Hope this helps.

I agree... And if possible make it easy...lol We are a bunch of old guys, gaming, and right now I am the only one who has stream set up on my PS5. The other guys have Xboxes, and we all want to stream to our channel. No idea how to do that, but apparently not possible with out a bunch of work...
 
100% agree with this that Twitch should allow API keys unique per console, people often collaborate and I have multiple streamers who stream on my 1 channel taking turns, I need to be able to have multiple Xbox and PlayStations connecting to my Twitch account without disconnecting previous ones.
 
my brother and I co-run a channel, and I have my xbox one linked, which means he cannot have his xbox one linked. And we live several hours away from eachother. He's now has to resort to streaming on his own channel, and hope that the main channel will "Host" him automatically, which is less than ideal.
 
Why can't the xbox one twitch app just allow me to input a valid twitch stream key? I mean you COULD check that i'm not using a restream or mixer or youtube live or any other key just by the prefix and expected string formatting unique to twitch stream keys
