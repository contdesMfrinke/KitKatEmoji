The KeyboardEvent.code property represents a physical key on the keyboard (as opposed to the character generated by pressing the key). In other words, this property returns a value that isn't altered by keyboard layout or the state of the modifier keys.

If the input device isn't a physical keyboard, but is instead a virtual keyboard or accessibility device, the returned value will be set by the browser to match as closely as possible to what would happen with a physical keyboard, to maximize compatibility between physical and virtual input devices.
 
This property is useful when you want to handle keys based on their physical positions on the input device rather than the characters associated with those keys; this is especially common when writing code to handle input for games that simulate a gamepad-like environment using keys on the keyboard. Be aware, however, that you can't use the value reported by KeyboardEvent.code to determine the character generated by the keystroke, because the keycode's name may not match the actual character that's printed on the key or that's generated by the computer when the key is pressed.
 
For example, the code returned is "KeyQ" for the Q key on a QWERTY layout keyboard, but the same code value also represents the ' key on Dvorak keyboards and the A key on AZERTY keyboards. That makes it impossible to use the value of code to determine what the name of the key is to users if they're not using an anticipated keyboard layout.

This example establishes an event listener for keydown events that handle keyboard input for a game that uses the typical "WASD" keyboard layout for steering forward, left, backward, and right. This will use the same four keys physically regardless of what the actual corresponding characters are, such as if the user is using an AZERTY keyboard.
 
The first section of the JavaScript code establishes some variables we'll be using. shipSize contains the size of the ship the player is moving around, for convenience. position is used to track the position of the ship within the play field. moveRate is the number of pixels each keystroke moves the ship forward and backward, and turnRate is how many degrees of rotation the left and right steering controls apply per keystroke. angle is the current amount of rotation applied to the ship in degrees; it starts at 0 (pointing straight up). Finally, spaceship is set to refer to the element with the ID "spaceship", which is the SVG polygon representing the ship the player controls.
 
Next comes the function updatePosition(). This function takes as input the distance the ship is to be moved, where positive is a forward movement and negative is a backward movement. This function computes the new position of the ship given the distance moved and the current direction the ship is facing. It also handles ensuring that the ship wraps across the boundaries of the play field instead of vanishing.
 
Finally, the addEventListener() method is used to start listening for keydown events, acting on each key by updating the ship position and rotation angle, then calling refresh() to draw the ship at its new position and angle.
 
There are several ways this code can be made better. Most real games would watch for keydown events, start motion when that happens, and stop the motion when the corresponding keyup occurs, instead of relying on key repeats. That would allow both smoother and faster movement, but would also allow the player to be moving and steering at the same time. Transitions or animations could be used to make the ship's movement smoother, too.
 
For example, the code returned is \"KeyQ\" for the Q key on a QWERTY layout keyboard, but the same code value also represents the ' key on Dvorak keyboards and the A key on AZERTY keyboards. That makes it impossible to use the value of code to determine what the name of the key is to users if they're not using an anticipated keyboard layout.

QR Code is a two-dimensional version of the barcode, typically made up of black and white pixel patterns. Denso Wave, a Japanese subsidiary of the Toyota supplier Denso, developed them for marking components in order to accelerate logistics processes for their automobile production. Now, it has found its way into mobile marketing with the widespread adoption of smartphones. "QR" stands for "Quick Response", which refers to the instant access to the information hidden in the Code.
 
They are gaining popularity because of their versatility. You can use them to gather feedback to improve your products or services, increase customer engagement with images or videos, or even promote your business via events and coupons. All of these can be done with just a single scan!
 
It is a niche tool that is used to generate different types of QR Codes. Depending on your purpose, you can use our generator to create QR Codes to open a website, view a PDF file, listen to music, watch Youtube videos, store image files, connect to a WiFi network, and much more. Explore the different types here.
 
Yes, it is possible with our PRO version. You can track the number of scans, where, and when it was scanned. You can even see which operating system your audience uses on their devices! All of these are important metrics for you to measure your campaigns and use it to improve or even expand.
 
Once generated, a Static Code cannot be edited and its scans cannot be tracked. Dynamic Code, on the other hand, is very flexible and is virtually indestructible. You can update its content, change/add links, and fix typos; even after print. You can also track the number of scans, including where and when.
 
After signing up, you will have the chance to try all the features of our generator free for 14 days. There, you can create Static and Dynamic QR Codes, design with colors and logos, choose frames, save designs as templates, edit the short URLs, set up your own domain, add team members, and many other exciting features.
 
Yes. This is because they have 40 different versions with four error correction levels and eight masking possibilities. This means there are 1280 possible QR Codes for any given input. However, for marketing purposes, only versions 1-7 are used so our generator will typically choose the best version based on the amount of data stored and the best mask to produce a better image in terms of readability.
 
Use our API, which you can integrate directly into your existing system. You can create either the standard black and white Codes or full customization with colors and designs. Still not sure? Contact us.
 
You can download them in high-resolution JPG format. To download in PNG, SVG, or even EPS, account signup is required. Please take note that if you require the QR Code image in EPS format, we only offer them in black and white without any designs.
