Previously i had installed Hifont. using HiFont i could open my file but is there any way to open these kind of file without using hifont or any type of installer? Please Help me...
 
Copy the fonts to /usr/local/share/fonts or a subfolder (such as /usr/local/share/fonts/TTF) and then run sudo fc-cache -fv. There are some graphical programs you can install to make this easier, but I've never felt the need to try any of them. The Ubuntu wiki page on Fonts here may be of help too.

Fontmatrix is a real Linux font manager, available on any platform and as well for KDE (which already had Kfontinstaller) as for Gnome. It's purpose is to recursively query the fonts (ttf, ps & otf) in the directories you give it to search, sort them quickly, (avoiding bugged or broken ones) and show them. Then, you can tag them, sub-tag, re-sort according various tags, preview... Even create a pdf Font Book...
 
Fontmatrix has been available to install from the Ubuntu universe repository since jaunty, and version 0.6.0+svn20100107-2ubuntu2 is currently in maverick and natty. A brief explanation about using fontmatrix is available on their website.
 
Also, there are lots of fonts available as software packages. Font packages are named in the form ttf-\* or otf-\*. It is better to install fonts as packages instead of manually if possible. You can use tools such as Synaptic, apt-get or the Ubuntu Software Centre. The Software Centre has a dedicated fonts section.
 
A better answer than the one provided there (i.e. to go to Google Fonts and look up the font and go through their weird downloading system) is to get it directly from Github, e.g.:Roboto Mono font files
 
PS: There's another duplicate question at "Downloading Google Fonts". It details some other methods, like using an installer script from googlecode.com and (for more than the Google Fonts) using tasksel.

I think the best way is to use gfinstall script, install it and you just say gfinstall whicheverFont and it will install it, you can also specify it to install locally (for the current user) or globally for all users
 
The default font in most androids is Droid-Sans which Google took 2 years to perfect. Although it offers good readability and goes easy on the eyes, android doesn't have a built-in option to change it.
 
But you can easily change the default android font to any of 200+ fonts using the **Font Installer** app. Once installed, it will ask permission to download more than 200 fonts from its store. If you choose not to download, it will show a list of all 200 font names to choose from, but you won't be able to preview them. On the other hand if you choose to download, the app will show the fonts exactly the way they look and will also offer a preview option.
 
Tip: If you experience a download hang while downloading fonts, don't wait. Just go back using your android phone's back button, open the app once again and when asked, choose the download option. Font installer will start downloading only those fonts which are not already downloaded.
 
I'm designing and prototyping an android app in Figma Linux but there is no way to add custom/desktop font in the application or in the web version. Figma only lists the Google fonts only. Please help me to solve this issue. I really need to add some fonts for my native language.
 
Despite Figma claiming to be platform-independent, the truth is that without this shim (kudos to the creator) Figma isn't viable on Linux since users are limited to a tiny selection of non-proprietary fonts.
 
Elevate your React Native applications with the power of customizable vector icons. Ideal for embellishing buttons, logos, and navigation or tab bars, these icons seamlessly integrate into your projects. Their versatility makes extension and styling effortless.
 
Should you find this library beneficial, kindly contemplate the option of sponsoring. Our envisioned endeavors encompass the restructuring of the repository into a monorepo architecture. This transition will empower independent versioning of icon sets, enhance performance, reduce bundle size, and simplify community contributions. Your sponsorship plays a pivotal role in materializing these advancements.
 
When using auto linking, it will automatically add all fonts to the **Build Phases**, **Copy Pods Resources**. Which will end up in your bundle.To avoid that, create a react-native.config.js file at the root of your react-native project with:
 
Browse to the node\_modules/react-native-vector-icons folder and drag the Fonts folder into your project in Xcode. Ensure that your app is checked under "Add to targets," and select "Create folder references" when prompted.
 
Edit your Info.plist and include a new property named **Application fonts resource path** (or ATSApplicationFontsPath if Xcode's autocomplete isn't functioning or you're not using Xcode). Set the value of this property to Fonts.
 
Please note that after adding new fonts, you need to recompile your project. Also, make sure that the Fonts folder is present under the **Copy Bundle Resources** section within the **Build Phases** of your Xcode project.
 
a. Right-click the Assets folder in your solution.b. Select **Add > Existing Item**.c. Browse and select the fonts that you copied into /windows/project-name/assets.d. Click **Add**.
 
Upgrading this package often requires the font files linked to your projects to be updated as well. If the automatic linking works for you, running this again should update the fonts. Otherwise you need to follow the steps outlined in the installation section.
 
Alternatively you may use the synchronous method Icon.getImageSourceSync to avoid rendering glitches. Keep in mind that this method is blocking and might incur performance penalties. Subsequent calls will use cache however.
 
Returns your own custom font based on the glyphMap where the key is the icon name and the value is either a UTF-8 character or it's character code. fontFamily is the name of the font **NOT** the filename. Open the font in Font Book.app or similar to learn the name. Optionally pass the third fontFile argument for android support, it should be the custom font file name.
 
Make sure you're using the Download option in IcoMoon, and use the .json file that's included in the .zip you've downloaded. You'll also need to import the .ttf font file into your project, following the instructions above.
 
React Native comes with an amazing animation library called Animated. To use it with an icon, simply create an animated component with this line: const AnimatedIcon = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Icon). You can also use the higher level animation library react-native-animatable.
 
Since TabBarIOS was removed from core in favor of @react-navigation/bottom-tabs, it is also removed as a convenience component from this library. Simply use the Icon instead, but don't forget to import and link to this project as described above first.
 
Since ToolbarAndroid was removed from core, it is also removed as a convenience component from this library. Simply use getImageSourceSync instead, but don't forget to import and link to this project as described above first.
 
Both npm and android file hierarchies tend to get very deep and even worse when you combine them. Since Windows file system has a max length, long file name addresses will result in numerous errors including Execution failed for task ':react-native-vector-icons:processReleaseResources'. So try to keep the path to your project folder as short as possible.
 
You probably didn't update the font files linked to your native project after upgrading. However, this only applies to Android targets since iOS bundles the fonts when building the app (try to clean your build from Xcode if the problem exists). On android you can relink the project or you manually update the fonts. To have them automatically synced use the gradle approach.
 
You are probably trying to use @expo/vector-icons and react-native-vector-icons at the same time. The expo package aliases this one and will take precedence. Use only one of these libraries in your project.
 
For example, to add react-native-vector-icons to the list of modules that support JSX (if using webpack) you may need to add the relative path to react-native-vector-icons in the include section of your JSX config.
