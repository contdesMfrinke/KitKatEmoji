**LIMBO** is a 2.1 Extreme Demon mega-collaboration hosted and published by MindCap, co-hosted by Djoxy and verified by BUNNYGRAM on 26 November 2022 after 109,490 attempts.[1] The level is designed in a 1.9 style with a mix of indigo, dark blue and red, similar to the last 25% of weoweoteo's Extreme Demon Marathon but more detailed. The theme is also similar to both Hinds' and Vlacc's parts in Cybernetic Crescent. It is made to be the hardest memory Demon without relying on visual interference while implementing unique gameplay mechanics.

MindCap had stated that the version of the level from January 2022 would probably have fallen into the Top 20-30 of the Demonlist. Some playtesters had stated the buffed version that followed to be Top 1 difficulty. Due to its memory, LIMBO's relative difficulty is uniquely challenging to gauge.
 
On 27 August 2022, BUNNYGRAM returned to the level and started his verification of a further buffed version that he, at the time, believed to potentially be harder than Slaughterhouse, the #1 level on the Demonlist at the time. This version ended up being verified by BUNNYGRAM and placed at #7.
 
LIMBO received acclaim from players for its concept, design, decoration, effects, gameplay and music, and is widely considered one of the best top Demons in recent history and one of the best levels of all time.[2][3][4]

LIMBO is themed around being trapped between heaven and hell. With the player not knowing where to go, it is up to them to decide their fate as they venture through the wonders of different technological and demonic hallucinations.
 
The story of LIMBO is about a steel factory manager in the 1980s who hired a scientist to create artificial intelligence that would solve the dangerous situations of the factory. The steel factory suffered ten casualties whilst some workers quit due to the hazardous conditions they worked in; therefore, the manager decided to replace all the factory workers with artificial intelligence capable of performing all the tasks at once.
 
The creation was finished and named **EAM-17**. It was considered the scientist's greatest invention. It took him around 17 prototypes to create the final product; however, he thinks his creation is not yet ready for commercial use. The manager replied that it was indeed a marvellous machine, exclusive to his company. The manager ensures that the scientist should not worry about making profits with this machine since he will soon build an 'unstoppable team'.
 
The scientist then reminded the manager there is a failsafe in the form of a combination code, which perhaps activated with a key in the control room. However, the manager replies that he has not seen the machine work in real-time yet, so he demands the scientist get it working. The scientist then responds about the purpose of the machine itself and expresses his concern towards the workers who have families to raise and the fact that he is monopolising the industry.
 
The manager exclaimed the scientist to silence, telling him a nave young man like him would never understand this would be the new direction towards the future. Everything would become automated, and personnel would no longer have input. It is a sacrifice through every big step. The manager also added that he dislikes how the press pushes him into talking about how he treats his employees. The scientist calls him out that his greed would force thousands into destitution through this cruel means. When the manager reminded him of his sick mother, Betty, the scientist told him not to remind him of her. They continued to prepare for the machine's operations and reminded him about the safety precaution key. The manager calls the weird-looking key an 'elaborate gag' of his due to the colours. The two then started EAM-17 to work, hoping that the manager would gain profit.
 
Six days have passed, and the machine functions according to plan, with increasing sales of the factory going on a long shot. However, at one point, it malfunctioned and stopped completely. The manager called the scientist to check on the machine, and then he headed towards the control room to assess the situation. Before he could do so, suddenly, a gigantic claw made out of improvised objects from the factory grabbed the scientist. The scientist yells to grab the keys at the table and focus. However, the manager is confused as to which key is the one that would activate the failsafe. There were too many identical keys to differentiate. The malfunctioning robot kills the scientist by violently throwing him against the wall. The manager then tries to make a run for it and call the authorities, but the machine shuts down all the doors and kills him.
 
In the aftermath, the AI blends the entire factory like an abandoned facility every time they are threatened, ready to kill everyone who dares to enter its territory. The investigation of the deaths involving EAM-17 shows that the bodies were never recovered, and the police declared the manager and the scientist missing. Around 30 years later, a cube emerges, which is the reincarnation of the scientist.
 
The cube was sent to the same spot where he had died outside the factory, with his only goal being to prevent more casualties to the sentient AI and RETURN 0. He must overload its resources and take the right key to shut it down. On the other side, the manager woke up elsewhere, yelling for anyone around. He has woken up in his factory, where everything is strangely bluish and distorted. As he ventures through the factory, he touches a spike and reacts in pain, telling himself that he is back from the start.
 
At times, life changes and limbos render forward motion highly challenging. The trick is to do the dance as long as possible, trusting that resolution and forward motion are ahead, even if you have to walk around the stick and take a different path.

When the lockdowns from COVID-19 hit in the spring of 2020, Bryan Callaghan, like most people, had a lot of time on his hands. Rather than binging his way through the entire Netflix catalog, he focused even more intently on his online computer science courses that began in January 2020. In doing so, he discovered the mechanical keyboard niche.
 
As a mechanical keyboard artist and founder of Limbo Keys, Bryan designs and builds custom PC peripherals with a focus on custom mechanical keyboards. His debut product is the Limbo Keys Sidecar Acrylic Case, a stacked acrylic case designed to house two of the most iconic PCBs in the mechanical keyboard community: The CFTKB Discipline 65 and its companion, the Discipad.
 
An artist for many years in Tucson prior to living on the East Coast, Bryan has historically created products using agave, wood, crystals, gems, resins and glass. He had to translate what he knew working with organic materials into a design that made sense within the inorganic nature of tech.
 
For those who find factory keyboards too light and accidently trigger the wrong keys when transitioning from key to key, then a keyboard with firm switches is for you. Limbo Keys can even specify the exact pressure used to trigger each key.
 
If you really want to have some fun with custom mechanical keyboards, add some color. Make everything electric green, brilliant blue or even a rainbow of colors. Add LED lights that change color at your command. Back lighting and underlighting is huge for those who like to work at night, in low light or just want to see their fingers glow.
 
When you combine keyboard pressure, sound, color, layout and style, the result is a one-of-a-kind mechanical keyboard that brings a more enjoyable typing experience and personalized aesthetic to a vital piece of technology people use every day. This kind of artisan luxury is in high demand.
 
Apart from the common keyboards available at any big box store, mechanical keyboards find their relevance in customization and transform the user experience. Through the custom mechanical keyboards Limbo Keys offers, Bryan takes this experience a step further into unique styles and original design elements that separate it from the other designs currently on the mechanical keyboard market.
 
At first, the item will only have one blue key. Getting a kill with this item will add another key, maxing out to 8 keys. The key colors in order are blue, pink, red, mint, cyan, purple, yellow, and green. These keys lengthen the hitbox of the item along with other boosts.
 
Using the item will perform a 2-swing combo, each swing dealing 15 damage and stun. The damage increases by +2 every key, maxing out to 29 damage. The user then will suffer a 1 second
