Chloe decides to end up asking her anyways and comes out with a response of a big fat NO! Chloe is very upset and hides away in her room, a few days later her mom seems excited about something and tells Chloe she found a summer program to enlist her in to prepare her for her future in a more business set environment. Chloe knows she cannot argue with her mother and ends up going, when she arrives she meets all new kinds of people, but then she notices her crush is going to the same program!
