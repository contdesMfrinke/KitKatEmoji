Power Lily pairs very well with Tile Turnip, as the latter's chain effect can greatly amplify the one single Plant Food that the Power Lily generates. In return, Power Lily allows for more frequent usage of Tile Turnip, due to two Tile Turnips generating huge amounts of sun, especially when Power Lily is imitated, allowing the player to plant more Tile Turnips. In adventure levels, only use Power Lilies in higher stages if there are few or no zombies that provide Plant Food. Some examples are 22-2 and 22-5.
 
On the other hand, Power Lilies shine in the Endless Zones, as the zombies may only drop one or two Plant Food during a level. Plant Food is very helpful for getting tons of sun by using it on Twin Sunflowers, freezing all the zombies with an Iceberg Lettuce, buttering all the zombies with a Kernel-pult, or summoning a deadly melon hail with a Winter Melon. Also consider refilling your stack by delaying the last zombie in the final wave by saving its life by digging the plant that would kill that zombie. Have the last standing zombie eat a Wall-nut. Keep the zombie busy by eating it but do not overdo it. Once it has reached the second degrade, have it repaired by Wall-nut First Aid. An alternative strategy would be the usage of either Chard Guard or Hurrikale to keep the zombies from reaching the player's home. Keep on placing Power Lilies until your Plant Food stock is full. Though, think rationally while playing Endless Zones. Do not worry about losing your stack of Plant Food since the main goal is to survive. Only refill your stack once the horde subsides to the minimum level. Do this on any other levels of Endless Zones if you feel you are at the risk of being outmatched.

In Arthur's Challenge for example, especially on three-digit levels where Wizard Zombies and Dark Ages Gargantuars come in great concentrations, Power Lily makes a great use here, but you must have a Tile Turnip. At least four of those can be planted on any desired column, but they are best to be safe from behind. Then, you can combine the power of Sun-shroom, Iceberg Lettuce, Laser Bean, Magnet-shroom, Winter Melon, or Twin Sunflower. Not only will you just conserve one Plant Food, but you will also able to cut off the horde and drastically increase your sun production.
 
Steam Ages takes place during the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. During this period of time, the predominant source of power was steam produced from burning coal, in which many of the inventions of this era needed at the time.
 
Sewers decorate the lawn of Steam Ages. Players can only plant flying plants, instant-use plants and most wall plants on sewers. Sewers are used by zombies as a way to enter the lawn from behind, eating the player's plants from the back.
 
*In the times of the greatest industrial advancement of the late 19th century, the zombies are hard at work. Filled with machinery and sewer holes, your plants will have a tough time defending your brains from both directions!*
 
Reverse Engineering is Steam Ages' exclusive Brain Buster. In this Brain Buster, the player is tasked to prevent backwards zombies that rise from sewers from reading blueprints laid out on the lawn. Failure to do so results in the zombies reading the said blueprints and a loss for the player.
 
Special Delivery is a Brain Buster featuring a conveyor belt, with said conveyor belt being the only way to recieve plants. No sun is needed in this Brain Buster, as plants given by the conveyor belt are free of charge. Certain levels may have a hard limit for a specific plant, and the frequency of each plant appearing can vary depending on the level.
 
Save Our Seeds is a Brain Buster where the player is tasked to protect a number of endangered plants throughout the entire level. Getting one of the endangered plants destroyed in any way (i.e. eaten, crushed, etc.), or activated in the case of plants such as Potato Mine or Lava Guava, will result in a loss for the player.
 
Last Stand is a Brain Buster where the player is given an extreme amount of sun and a limited amount of Plant Food to use for the entire level. The player must set up a strong defense beforehand before advancing. Most free plants and all sun-producing plants are banned in these levels, and any more Plant Food is not handed out throughout the level, though certain levels may have at least one carrier of it in it.
 
Locked and Loaded is a Brain Buster here the player is forced to use the plants given in the level. They are only required to use the plants given to them in order to win the level. Even if certain plants given in the level have yet to be unlocked, the player still has the ability to use that plant within the level itself. This can serve as a demo for that plant if that ever manages to happen.
 
Brain Drain Factory is Steam Ages's Endless Zone, unlocked at Steam Ages - Day 20. Much like every other endless zone, levels get harder and tougher as you progress here. Sewers will limit your planting space and necessitate backward attacking plants, appearing in generally larger numbers and closer to the left of the lawn on later levels.
 
The player must fight Dr. Zomboss in Steam Ages piloting the Loco-motive. It can summon almost all zombies found in the world. Plants in these levels are only given to the player through a conveyor belt. The Zombot Loco-motive itself can attack the player's plants by launching backward Industrial Imps.
 
Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 offers a wide array of plants and zombies to choose from, with variants on each one. This guide will walk you through all the details you need to know to unlock the characters and variants that you're looking to play.
 
You have a few methods of earning characters, depending on how much you need consumable items to use in battle. All of these are purchasable using in-game currency in the vending machine, which is located next to the hall of heroes for both Plants and Zombies.
 
If you aren't concerned about gaining consumables, the most fool-proof and cost-efficient way to earn characters is the Phenomenal Character Pack for 75,000 coins. This pack contains no consumables at all, but guarantees a Rare or Super Rare character unlock.
 
If you want a cheaper option that gets you consumables and will also eventually pay off with a character, get either the Fertilizer Fun Pack or the Amazing Brainz Pack for 35,000 coins. Those offer lots of consumable items, and a high likelihood (but not a guarantee) of a character piece. You could also get the Wondrous Pack of Greatness for 35,000, which has the best likelihood of a Super Rare character piece.
 
As the names imply, the Fertilizer Fun and Amazing Brainz packs are split between the Plant and Zombie factions, so if you're fishing for a missing piece in one faction or the other, this may be the way to go. However, since it only offers one character piece, it would take five of them (totalling 175,000 coins) to get the same amount of character value as one Phenomenal Character Pack. That means the consumables and customization items would need to be worth 100,000 coins, and the cheaper options are generally better for those.
