
 
Start by lying down on your back. Bring your knees up to your chest and put your hands under your hips. Next, stretch the legs out and raise them up to 90 degrees. When you have done that, return to the first position with them near your chest. Repeat 108 times.
 
The final part of this Kundalini Yoga kriya is relaxation. Get into Corpse Pose to begin. Allow the weight to be drained from your body as you completely relax and meditate. Continue in this state of sheer bliss for 8 minutes and then finish.

The human body is remarkably resilient. It can withstand weeks of stress, heaps of junk food and ceaseless negative thoughts without a single crack in the system. But after time, this negativity begins to pollute your body, hampering your health and causing severe damage to your spiritual and emotional well-being.
 
The Shat Kriyas, also known as Shatkarma Kriyas, is a set of yogic cleansing practices that purify the internal body and restart the system. This ancient yogic cleanse purges the body of accumulated toxins and waste, creating a clean environment where positive thoughts flow and ordinary experiences feel electric.
 
Apart from purging the body of unwanted waste, these yogic cleansing exercises are also used to banish impurities from the mind. The result is a total mind-body cleanse with a plethora of short- and long-term health benefits.
 
**Step 2**: Fill the Neti pot with the water and position the spout in one nostril. Lean forward and tilt your head towards the opposite side. To stimulate the flow of the water, breathe through your mouth and take several deep breaths.
 
Another well-known variation of this yogic cleansing technique is Vastra Dhauti. Meaning cloth, Vastra is the process of slipping a long cotton cloth down the throat and into the stomach. The cloth scrubs the walls of the stomach and removes leftover waste stuck in your gut.
 
Tratak aims to improve the health of your eyes. This exercise is done by focusing on a single object until your eyes begin to tear up. There are several variations of Tratak. Some favor moon gazing or dot gazing, but candle gazing is the most popular and beginner-friendly yogic purification exercise for the eyes.
 
In many ways, Shat Kriyas is the ultimate mind-body cleanse. However with all cleanses, the Shat Kriyas should be practiced with caution and careful consideration. When performed correctly, these Hatha purification exercises can cleanse your internal body and help you connect to yoga beyond the physical practice of asanas.

This mantra helps to move from fear of change to boldness and courage. It removes feelings of anxiety, depression and phobias, leaving in its place courage and victory. Just like the snake leaving behind its old skin.
 
These words bring victory during changing times! Chant along with my favorite version by Nirinjan Kaur or keep it playing in your house! I practiced this every morning for 11 minutes (the length of the recording) and I added this mudra:
 
**Mudra:** Rest your elbows alongside your rib cage. Place your hands in front of your chest, palms facing upward, with the two Mercury (pinkie) fingers touching and the outside part of the base of the palms touching. Keep the Sun (ring) fingers and the Jupiter (index) fingers straight and the thumbs pulled back. Touch the tips of the Saturn (middle) fingers so that they form a triangle. The mudra is held before the heart center in a comfortable, prayerful position, but it does not touch the chest.
 
Kirtan Kriya, often referred to as SA TA NA MA meditation, is the most important meditation in Kundalini Yoga. If you can do only one meditation, this is it. It will readjust and align you to bring balance into your body, mind and spirit and thus your life. It is your teacher. It is your best friend. The bottom line is that this meditation works. All you have to do is do it. You can trust the process and the technology.
 
While chanting alternately press the thumb with the four fingers on both hands simultaneously. Press hard enough to keep yourself awake and aware of the pressure. Keep repeating in a stable rhythm and keep the hand motion going throughout the whole meditation.
 
**SA** press the thumb and the pointer or Jupiter finger together with pressure. The Jupiter/Pointer finger brings in knowledge, expands our field of possibilities and releases us from limitations.
 
Visualize or feel each individual sound come in the crown chakra at the top of the head, down through the middle of the head and out to infinity through the third eye. This is very important and must be done with each sound. It is an essential part of the cleansing process. If this part of the meditation is not done, you may experience a headache.
 
Meditation comes in many shapes and sizes. Some people like to sit cross legged and try to think of nothing, some people like to be guided with journeys either to real places or those that are steeped deep in mysticism, the subtle body or connected to mother earth. I have been meditating now consistently for about 6 years (although I cannot really remember when started-my journey with meditation which started in 2010).
 
After many starts and stops and forgotten moments when I was supposed to meditate but that day would just go by and I would never find the time to fit it in, I started meditating in the morning. Every morning. I found that that was the perfect time for me to meditate. It was before Anthony woke up when he still needed me in the mornings and now I just love that quiet personal moment each morning.
 
Whatever your ilk is, there is meditation style right for you. Start small. Stay consistent. And there is no failure in meditating. No end goal but to do it. But if you do not meditate one day, there is always tomorrow (or that night!) See the chart below, even 3-minutes is a pot of gold! I do numerous 3-minutes throughout the day-just three deep breaths elongated!
 
Here are some pose variations that might make the practice more accessible for you. Adaptation is a beautiful gift to yourself to enjoy the practice from where you are with no comparison and no expectations.
 
Also, Kundlini is a gold mine when it comes to varied meditations. Kundalini offers metal, physical and emotional distractions that ope the gateway for meditation that is wholly enjoyable and accessible.
 
**3 minutes:** Affects your circulation, blood chemistry and stability of the blood. The increased blood circulations begins, distributing enhanced neuroendocrine secretions throughout the body.
 
**7 minutes:** Brain patterns start to shift from the static of beta waves, to calmer alpha waves and ultimately to deep relaxing delta waves. Simultaneously, the magnetic force surrounding the body increases in strength.
 
**11 minutes:** The pituitary gland, glandular system and the nerves start to learn and change. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems begin to accommodate the increased energy.
 
**22 minutes:** Anxiety producing thoughts in the subconscious begin to clear. Your three minds (negative, positive, and neutral) start to work together so your mental integration changes. 22 is the infinite number of longing and gives mastery of the mental realm.
 
**120 days:** When you commit to practice the Kriya or mantra for 120 days without skipping a day it will confirm the new habit of consciousness. The positive benefits of the Kriya get integrated permanently into your psyche.
 
**1000 days:** This will allow you to master the new habit of consciousness that the Kriya or mantra has promised. No matter what the challenge, you can call on this new habit to serve you.
 
Here is the video of the practice and below are all the various chair adaptations for the set. If you have a specific issue and would like a different adaptation, please comment and I will make poses for you.
 
**Posture:** Raise arms up to a 60 degree angle. Keep elbows straight and the shoulders down. Apply Neck Lock. Curl fingertips onto the pads of the palms at the base of the fingers. Thumbs stretched back, pointing towards each other. Feel a rainbow streching over your head thumb tip to thumb tip.
 
**To end:** Inhale deeply and bring arms overhead with the thumb tips touching. Open the fingers (like moose antlers), exhale and relax the arms down in a wide arch, feeling the rainbow expand.
 
This version of the meditation is a key to opening the flow of Kundalini. **The new awareness will give you the authority to make the right choices to conquer the ugliness of life. You will be peaceful and secure.** \*Yeah, I need this!
 
\*Passing by Heart Center, begin to open the hand mudra to resemble a lotus flower; fully open by the time the hands reach the level of the Brow Point. (The open lotus has the base of the palms together, the little finger tips touch and the thumb tips touch. The rest of the fingers are spread open to express an open lotus flower.)
 
\*It is a reverse Prayer Pose. Slowly bring this mudra down the chakras in rhythm with the music until the fingertips reach the Navel Point on the sounds *Har Rang*. Then turn them around and begin again.
 
Alternately strike the sides of the hands together. When the palms are face down, the sides of the Jupiter (index) fingers touch, and the thumbs cross below the hands, with the right thumb under the left.
 
Inhale and raise the arms up over the head while simultaneously drawing the knees up towards the center of the body. Exhale and lower the knees and arms down to the original position. Continue rhythmically coordinating the movement with powerful breathing for 8 minutes. This exercise balances the prana and apana, and sets the navel point.
 
Try taking a few minutes to massage yourself at your desk between tasks, on the couch at the end of a hectic day, or in
