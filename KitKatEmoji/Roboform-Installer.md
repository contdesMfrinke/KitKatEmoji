The universal Mac installer installs RoboForm along with the Safari extension. Adds offline access, the ability to stay logged in between multiple browser types, and biometric authentication. PKG format.
 
Roboform keeps popping up a window asking for feedback after I've uninstalled it on windows 10. It has popped up so much time already that my browser(microsoft edge chromium) autocompletes it after I enter roboform in my address bar. I've entered some stuff in the feedback box at least fifteen times. How do I stop it?
 
Upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10 went fine, but I notice that the Roboform toolbar is missing in Firefox in my wife's Standard User local account (but it IS there in IE11). The toolbar shows up as normal in both browsers in my Admistrative local user account. In Firefox, clicking on View/Toolbars does not show Roboform as an option. I've tried uninstalling Roboform and re-installing the most recent version but the same thing occurs.

Firefox/Add-ons/Extensions:(1) Does not show Roboform at all.(2) From the Roboform taskbar icon, opening Options/Browser Integration, clicking the Firefox-based browsers button and dragging the green puzzle piece into the Firefox Extensions window makes the Roboform Toolbar extension show up. GOOD!!
 
IE11 Enhanced Protected Mode:(1) In my Administrative account, disabling this as suggested allows the Roboform toolbar to show up.(2) In my wife's Standard account, the toolbar show up even with EPM enabled. ?????Verdict: puzzling, but everything is working as before and the Roboform toolbar is showing up everywhere. Since we don't use IE11 as our default browser, this is not a problem.
 
This will disable add-on signature enforcement;Enter **about:config** into your Firefox address bar Click the I'll be careful button Find **xpinstall.signatures.required** in the list Right click the preference Select Toggle until the value is false -US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox
