A QR Code can store up to 3,000 characters, including URLs. Widely used in digital marketing, it allows quick access to information via smartphone camera scanning without an app. The QR Code was invented in 1994 by Denso Wave, a subsidiary of Toyota.
 
A DataMatrix barcode encodes up to 2,335 characters in a compact, square format. Ideal for small items, it's commonly used in electronics, manufacturing, and healthcare. RVSI Acuity CiMatrix developed this 2D barcode in 1989.
 
Universal Product Code - A is mainly used in the North American retail industry for checkouts and inventory tracking. It works by encoding a unique 12-digit number to identify each item. It was introduced by IBM in 1973.
 
A UPC-E barcode is a compressed form of UPC-A that encodes the 12-digit identifier into six digits. It is used in North American retail but on smaller items with limited packaging space. IBM also developed UPC-E in 1973.
 
The European Article Number - 13 (EAN-13) is similar to UPC-A but is used for sales and inventory worldwide, not just in North America. The EAN-13 barcode uniquely identifies products with a 13-digit code and was established by GS1 in 1973.
 
The EAN-8 barcode is a compact version of EAN-13. It is designed for items with limited labelling space, as it encodes the information into an 8-digit code. It is globally recognised and was first introduced by GS1 in 1970.
 
Code 128 barcodes encode 128 ASCII characters. This alphanumeric barcode is versatile and widely used in packaging and shipping due to its high data density. Computer Identics Corp created Code 128 in 1981.
 
Code 39 barcodes encode letters, numbers, and special characters, up to 43 characters. Known as "Alpha39" or "Code 3 of 9", it's popular in the automotive industry and for warehouse labelling. Intermec Corp invented Code 39 in 1974.
 
Code 93 barcodes encode extended ASCII characters, up to 84 characters, providing higher data density. Similar to Code 39, it's often used in logistics and inventory management and was created by Intermec Corp in 1982.
 
Portable Data File 417 (PDF417) barcodes store large data volumes, up to 1850 characters, including text and images. PDF417 was invented by Symbol Technologies in 1991 and is typically used on government IDs and documents due to its high capacity and security features.
 
Aztec Code barcodes store up to 3000 characters in a dense 2D matrix. Recognisable by its central bullseye, it's often used for tickets in transportation, such as airline boarding passes. It was invented in 1995 by Andrew Longacre and Robert Hussey.
 
QR Code is a two-dimensional version of the barcode, typically made up of black and white pixel patterns. Denso Wave, a Japanese subsidiary of the Toyota supplier Denso, developed them for marking components in order to accelerate logistics processes for their automobile production. Now, it has found its way into mobile marketing with the widespread adoption of smartphones. "QR" stands for "Quick Response", which refers to the instant access to the information hidden in the Code.
 
They are gaining popularity because of their versatility. You can use them to gather feedback to improve your products or services, increase customer engagement with images or videos, or even promote your business via events and coupons. All of these can be done with just a single scan!
 
It is a niche tool that is used to generate different types of QR Codes. Depending on your purpose, you can use our generator to create QR Codes to open a website, view a PDF file, listen to music, watch Youtube videos, store image files, connect to a WiFi network, and much more. Explore the different types here.
 
Yes, it is possible with our PRO version. You can track the number of scans, where, and when it was scanned. You can even see which operating system your audience uses on their devices! All of these are important metrics for you to measure your campaigns and use it to improve or even expand.
 
Once generated, a Static Code cannot be edited and its scans cannot be tracked. Dynamic Code, on the other hand, is very flexible and is virtually indestructible. You can update its content, change/add links, and fix typos; even after print. You can also track the number of scans, including where and when.
 
After signing up, you will have the chance to try all the features of our generator free for 14 days. There, you can create Static and Dynamic QR Codes, design with colors and logos, choose frames, save designs as templates, edit the short URLs, set up your own domain, add team members, and many other exciting features.
 
Yes. This is because they have 40 different versions with four error correction levels and eight masking possibilities. This means there are 1280 possible QR Codes for any given input. However, for marketing purposes, only versions 1-7 are used so our generator will typically choose the best version based on the amount of data stored and the best mask to produce a better image in terms of readability.
 
Use our API, which you can integrate directly into your existing system. You can create either the standard black and white Codes or full customization with colors and designs. Still not sure? Contact us.
 
You can download them in high-resolution JPG format. To download in PNG, SVG, or even EPS, account signup is required. Please take note that if you require the QR Code image in EPS format, we only offer them in black and white without any designs.
 
Yes! For most iOS and Android users, a QR Code scanner is already built into the native camera app. Simply open the camera app and hold it over any Codes until a notification pops up. You don't even have to press any button to scan the Codes.

MobileDemand offers our free barcode generator to create a variety of common barcodes. These symbologies are used in many industries including logistics, inventory management, product identification, advertising, procurement and more.
 
Barcode sheets use a 1" x 2-5/8" layout that works with many popular label sheets including Avery Easy Peel. Each page can fit up to 30 barcodes. A maximum of 5 pages (150 labels) can be generated at a time.
 
A very effective, high-density symbology which permits the encoding of alphanumeric data. The symbology includes a checksum digit for verification, and the barcode may also be verified character-by-character verifying the parity of each data byte.
 
A barcode consists of parallel black bars that have often been likened to the stripes of a zebra. Each bar and the space between them have a unique width, making each barcode unique. Barcodes are designed to be read by specialized scanners and serve as a visual representation of an item's identification details. By scanning a barcode, you can quickly identify your item. While barcodes traditionally feature a black-and-white color scheme, there is potential to print them in various colors to blend with the design, but only as long as they remain scannable.
