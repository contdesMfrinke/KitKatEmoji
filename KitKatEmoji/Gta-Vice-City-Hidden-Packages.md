There are 100 GTA Vice City hidden packages stashed throughout the game, which look like little green Tiki statues. You'll receive $100 every time you pick one of them up, and for every 10 collected a new reward is unlocked. Below we have a list of all these rewards, with the armor and weapons spawning at your Ocean View Hotel, Vercetti Mansion, and Hyman Condo safehouses, while the vehicles appear at the stated locations:
 
It is one of the tasks required to achieve 100% completion in the game. They are implemented into the game in the form of pickups that glow and always spin in place and can be collected by walking into them.
 
Each hidden package will award the player with $100, as there are 100 packages in the game, collecting the packages alone will result in a total of $10000 earned. Reaching a certain amount of collected packages will award the player with several weapons that will then spawn in the Ocean View Hotel, the Vercetti Estate and the Hyman Condo.

Yes, there are hidden packages. I have found a few underwater in crashed planes and I'm sure there are a lot on land. There's apparently one near a military base with bodies around. Also, if you go into the water off the coast just north of the military base and find the plane wreck, the hidden package gives you 12,500 dollars. Switch to another character and back, and the package is there again.
 
Rockstar Games' **Grand Theft Auto**franchise has featured a large number of collectibles over the years, but the hidden packages shaped like green tiki statues in GTA: Vice City are especially memorable. Not only does collecting them provide new weapon spawns outside of Tommy Vercetti's home, but finding all 100 hidden packages in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City will also net players an exclusive ironic T-shirt and consistent access to dangerous airpower.
 
In Grand Theft Auto 3 hidden packages looked a lot like a flat slab wrapped in paper and tape - an image often associated with the shipping of illegal substances like cocaine. Grand Theft Auto 3 never outright says these hidden packages ARE cocaine, however, and given the game's focus on the new, fictional drunk hitting the streets of Liberty City called SPANK, it can be assumed these are indeed SPANK packages Claude is collecting. GTA: Vice City, however, is a little less subtle.
 
Instead of centering around a fictional drug, cocaine itself is heavily referenced throughout Grand Theft Auto: Vice City's story. A cocaine deal gone bad is the impetus for the game's entire plot, and players assist Tommy Vercetti in building a (partially) cocaine-funded empire through various takeovers, heists, and drug dealing side missions. Vice City is littered with cocaine - both figuratively and, when it comes to the game's hidden packages, quite literally.
 
The green Māori-like tiki statues that serve as GTA: Vice City's hidden packages are filled with cocaine. This is shown in Tommy Vercetti's own room at the Ocean View Hotel on the strip after players have completed the mission "Rub Out" and killed Ricardo Diaz, Vice City's original cocaine kingpin. Although quite bare in the opening moments of the game, Vercetti's hotel room slowly begins to fill with outfits, weapons, and items as players move the story forward, all of which help to illustrate his progression up Vice City's criminal underworld ladder. A broken tiki statue which looks identical to Vice City's hidden packages is one of these items, and it appears on Vercetti's desk in a large pile of cocaine.
 
The broken statue filled with drugs is a reference to Miami Vice - one of many scattered throughout Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. In the episode "Milk Run" in Miami Vice's first season, Crockett and Tubbs investigate a drug smuggling operation which is transporting cocaine - about $25,000 worth per statue - in a very similar fashion to what can be found in Vice City.
 
Not every Grand Theft Auto game uses drugs as a collectible item. GTA: San Andreas went all-out with collectibles, with everything from oysters to horseshoes spread across its map, but the dangers of abusing drugs like cocaine, heroin, and marijuana were focused on far more than the benefits - although Vice City's tiki statue did make an appearance outside a theater in San Andreas. Grand Theft Auto 5 allows players to actually get drunk or high themselves, but "collecting" drugs isn't something they are asked to do in their off time like finding nuclear waste or submarine parts - unless Peyote Plants count.
 
Hidden packages as they appeared in Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City haven't really been seen in the series since Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, and that's a shame. While it's not necessary to ask players to obtain drugs in any title, so many Grand Theft Auto games are filled with ancillary activities that aren't really related to the plot, and asking Tommy Vercetti to collect statues filled with cocaine makes complete sense both from a player's perspective (something fun to do) and from a character and plot perspective. Vercetti was constantly funding and building his empire, so of course he needed those statues. **Grand Theft Auto: Vice City's**hidden packages made sense - unlike Niko Bellic's murderous hated of pigeons.
 
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is often seen as a step up from Grand Theft Auto 3 in just about every way. It still contains the formula established by the 2001 predecessor in many ways, though. Similar to GTA 3, Vice City includes one 100 hidden packages for you to collect, and just over half of them are found on the first island.
 
The following guide details how to get all of the packages on the first island. It is organized from the north to the south, and at the end, we detail the packages you can only get using a helicopter. Like Grand Theft Auto 3, every ten you collect grants you a weapon or other pickup that waits for you at your safehouse or the Vercetti estate.
 
Cross the bridge onto Prawn Island for the next few packages. Head into the first ruined building. The package is inside a room you have to drop into from above. It can be hard to see the package from outside the room, but it is clearly visible once you are close.
 
Cross over to Starfish Island and then head to the Vercetti Estate (though it is Diaz's mansion if you have not done the Rub Out mission yet). The first package is close to the nearby pool by the stairs.
 
This script will assist in finding all of the hidden packages in the GTA Vice City main storyline. For any packages not yet picked up, the script creates marker at that package location and a brief description of where the package can be found. When you get to that package location, it will move to the next package automatically.

The broad consensus favoring reform of State government has helped focus public attention on abuses at State authorities. There is a clear need to reform the workings of both the Legislative and the Executive branches; most important for reform of the Executive branch is reigning in and controlling State authorities. The public authorities of the State have become, in recent years, a shadow government, making secret decisions that dramatically affect the daily lives of all New Yorkers. Whether you are concerned about mass transit, school construction, public debt, the cost of electricity, economic development, or the environment, State authorities are directly exercising enormous power over your lives and concerns.
 
The Committee on Corporations, Authorities, and Commissions is charged with overseeing all of New York's public and private corporations, its State authorities, and its commissions, which puts it at the center of the most vital issues facing New York. During the past year, the Committee has used its oversight power to great effect by holding public hearings into the activities of State authorities from Long Island to Buffalo. The Committee moved legislation through the Assembly, uncovered serious problems in telephone service across the state, examined abuses of public authorities, and pushed for more accountabili
