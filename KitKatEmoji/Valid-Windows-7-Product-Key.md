with the manual import option giving the following message:
**value [uTorrent\_Downloads/This.Is.Us.S04E18.1080p.WEB.H264-METCON] is not a valid Windows path. paths must be a full path eg. C:\Windows Parameter name: path**
 
If you're not afraid of Unicode, you can retain a bit more fidelity by replacing the invalid characters with valid Unicode symbols that resemble them. Here's the code I used in a recent project involving lumber cutlists:

I knew this trick would work on NTFS but was surprised to find it also works on FAT and FAT32 partitions. That's because long filenames are stored in Unicode, even as far back as Windows 95/NT. I tested on Win7, XP, and even a Linux-based router and they showed up OK. Can't say the same for inside a DOSBox.
 
Diego does have the correct solution but there is one very small mistake in there. The version of string.Replace being used should be string.Replace(char, char), there isn't a string.Replace(char, string)
 
Last but not least, it has a switch statement that returns look-alike characters which you can customize any way you wish. Check out Unicode.org's confusables lookup to see what options you might have, depending on the font.
 
There are no valid answers in this topic yet. Author said: "...I want to use as a filename...". Remove/replace invalid characters is not enough to use something as filename. You should at least check that:
 
The gist of the error message is '@job\_login must have a valid Windows login'. I can provide more specifics on what the practices involve, but as things stand I wouldn't know which details are relevant.
 
In order to address that question, I need to delve into the scripts produced by SSMS at various stages of the practice sequence. Please bear in mind that T-SQL is pretty new to me so please forgive me for not spotting what in all probability is fairly obvious.
 
Speaking of Server1 and ReplDistAgent for that matter, I just want to verify something. Is Server1 the name of the machine you are running this script on, or the name of the domain the server is a member of? And is ReplDistAgent an account on that machine/domain? Because if not, even if the syntax is correct it will not work because the account would not be valid. A pre-existing account needs to be specified for the parameter.

I ran through the practices a number of times in order to address various issues that arose along the way, and after each sequence I deleted the publication and 'disabled publishing and distribution'. I had simply failed to reset ReplDistAgent as dbo for Distribution again.
 
I can't open an Excel file that is important to me due to the extension not being valid or corrupted.
I've tried about everything that I could find online but havent been able to solve it, possibly due to a different Excel version?
 
Remember to create a backup of the corrupted file before attempting any repair methods, especially if you decide to use third-party tools. If none of the above methods work, it might be worth reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance or considering professional data recovery services.

@MathiasssI had the same problem when I copied a good file to a new subfolder. I think this was the issue: This error message occurs when you save or open a file if the path to the file (including the file name) exceeds 218 characters. This limitation includes three characters representing the drive, the characters in folder names, the backslash character between folders, and the characters in the file name.
 
I am installing the trial of Endpoint Protection for a client that has Windows 7 workstations running legacy software. I want to make them as secure as possible but I can't get the install to work. I tried on a windows 10 workstation and it worked fine.
 
This application has been revised several times over the past few months
with no major issues (I've now started onto Version 3 of this application).
Throughout this time, I've used eVB's Application Install Wizard to create a
new .cab file/setup file without any problems. I usually just copy the new
CAB file over to the handheld and execute it there. Now, however, I've come
across a problem...once the CAB file is copied to the handheld and I execute
it, I get the following error message:The file ".CAB" is not a valid Windows CE Setup
file.I've reviewed some code from a previous version (version 2), and aside from
the GUI and coding changes, the project environment itself seems to be
exactly the same, however, I can successfully compile the CAB file and
execute an install on the handheld for this version 2. I haven't added any
different controls to version 3, nor have I added any additional references,
etc.Am I missing something obvious here?Any help would be greatly appreciated...I hope this makes some sense. If
anyone needs further clarification, please let me know...Thanks!Tim Serr

 
I've compared the two .ebp project files using notepad to see if there were
any significant changes between the two. The only thing that seemed to stand
out was version 2 (the working file) had a call to register a common dialog
control. Version 3 doesn't have this object call.Strange thing is, I hadn't placed a common dialog control on the version 2
program, so I don't know why this was created in the first place.Long and short of it, I placed a common dialog control on my Version 3
program, and it now works. Figures!If anyone would like to share their thoughts on this, be my guest. I'm at a
loss here, though no longer at a project standstill."Tim Serr" wrote in message

I want to give you a couple of ideas:
- try to install the CAB file from desktop trough CeAppMgr,
 setting ReportErrors=1 (search "installing application manually"
 in the SDK documentation)
- try opening the CAB file with "WinCE CAB Manager"
 
 maybe it can give you some information--

I installed Windows Server 2016 on VirtualBox, and now I am trying to install DHCP server on my Windows Server 2016 machine, but I got an error. I set this machine as a Domain Controller before, so I thought this situation may cause the error. I searched it on web, and found a solution. Then I deleted some language packages from HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\PackageDetect, but it didn't solve the problem. What should I do to solve this?
 
The request to add or remove feautures on the specified server failed. Installation of one or more roles, role services, or features failed. The specified package is not valid Windows package. Error: 0x800f0805
 
If this was 64-bit XP, the only valid reason you would get that error with a correct download and properly functioning system is if you downloaded a 16-bit application. For 32-bit XP you would get that error with a 64-bit application. Audacity is 32-bit so that does not apply.
 
See Windows 7 and .exe is not a valid win 32 application message - Microsoft Community for some file system checks you can make. Or just backup your data and reinstall Windows, or (safer) install a version of Linux.

Why exactly has my last post documenting download sources and suggesting there is some issue with the way Audacity is being compiled/packaged rather than some issue with downloaded data not appeared as yet ?
 
FWIW, I have a Windows XP SP3 installation that I use for testing purposes. It has very little else on it other than Windows XP SP3, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 (required to run Audacity on Windows XP) and Audacity. Audacity 2.0.6 runs fine on that setup.
 
In short, whilst I cannot at this stage confirm whether there is/was a pre-existing malware issue with my system or not, all possible steps were taken to ensure that a valid zip file was obtained from a valid location and then checked locally prior to use.
 
[##] It looks like http: //> www.fosshub.com/Audacity.html/audacity-win-2.0.6.zip > may also be randomly linked to on some occasions, however, the resulting files appear to be identical to those from sourceforge.
 
(definitely not specifically aimed at the Audacity team but rather towards ALL software developers in general because this kind of nonsense wasting extraordinary amounts of my time really p\*\*\*\*s me off !)
 
Editing the manifest file as you did to V9.0.21022.8 does sometimes work on XP yes, but sometimes it does not. Hence the advice remains, run or repair the VS2008 SP1 redistributables. The error you got is not common (it should have been error 14001) so something non-standard is going on in your machine (whether you want to admit it or not). So the advice remains to check your system files. You have chosen to run a system that is no longer supported with essential security updates.
 
Just so you know, nothing will change with the current situation because it is history now. The next Audacity release will use VS2013. So do feel free to test 2.1.0-alpha on your system.

This is a genuine Microsoft Update site. If you go to any Microsoft KB article you'll see the link in the INTRODUCTION section (example). All old Windows Update addresses such as windowsupdate.microsoft.com and windowsupdate.com now redirect to the new update.microsoft.com.
 
The new domain seems to be a policy of unifying the update site for Microsoft's products under one name: Microsoft Update. As for the bad graphics and malware suspicions, a malware wouldn't really tell you to use a Microsoft application to update system. A malware usually tells you to click on shady links or asks you to download some "update helpers".
