Dev Drive builds on ReFS technology to employ targeted file system optimizations and provide more control over storage volume settings and security, including trust designation, antivirus configuration, and administrative control over what filters are attached.
 
When updating to the latest Windows 11 release, you may need an additional reboot before the Dev Drive feature becomes available. If you are working in a business enterprise environment, your security administrator will need to Configure Dev Drive security policy in order to enable Dev Drive.

Dev Drive is intended only for key developer scenarios and any custom settings will still be covered by Group Policy settings in Business or Enterprise work environments. Learn more about how to Configure Dev Drive security policy.
 
To format a Dev Drive on the new free space, specify the **Label** (drive name), **Drive Letter**, and **Size** allocation. The maximum size will be the amount of free space you allocated in the previous step, the minimum size for a Dev Drive is 50GB.
 
As an alternative to using Windows Settings, there are two options for creating Dev Drive storage volumes from the command line. Both options require that you open the command line as an Administrator. You must be a member of the Admin group to format a hard drive. These command line formatting methods may be preferred when creating multiple Dev Drives or as an admin for multiple machines.
 
A Storage Volume specifies how data is stored on the file system, via directories and files, in a particular format. Windows uses NTFS for the system drive and, by default, for most non-removable drives. The Resilient File System (ReFS) is a newer Microsoft file system format, designed to maximize data availability, scale efficiently to large data sets across diverse workloads, and provide data integrity with resiliency to corruption. It seeks to address an expanding set of storage scenarios and establish a foundation for future innovations.
 
The **Dev Drive** utilizes ReFS enabling you to initialize a storage volume specifically for development workloads, providing faster performance, and customizable settings that are optimized for development scenarios. ReFS contains several file system specific optimizations to improve the performance of key developer scenarios.
 
A package cache is the global folder location used by applications to store files for installed software. These source files are needed when you want to update, uninstall, or repair the installed software. Visual Studio is one such application that stores a large portion of its data in the Package Cache.
 
**Npm cache (NodeJS)**: Create an npm cache directory in your Dev Drive, e.g. D:\packages\npm, then set a global environment variable npm\_config\_cache to that path, e.g. setx /M npm\_config\_cache D:\packages\npm. If you have already installed NodeJS on your machine, move the contents of %AppData%\npm-cache to this directory. (On some systems the npm cache may be in %LocalAppData%\npm-cache). Learn more in the npm docs: npm-cache and npm config: cache.

**NuGet global-packages folder**: The NuGet global-packages folder is used by dotnet, MSBuild, and Visual Studio. Create a user specific NuGet directory in your CopyOnWrite (CoW) filesystem. For example: D:\\.nuget\packages. Use one of the following ways to change the global-packages folder from the default location to your newly created folder (to manage the globally installed packages):
 
To verify the global-packages folder, run the dotnet nuget locals command: dotnet nuget locals global-packages --list. The restore will install and download packages into the new path. The default NuGet global-packages folder can be deleted. Learn more in the NuGet docs: Managing the global packages, cache, and temp folders.
 
**vcpkg cache**: Create a vcpkg cache directory in your Dev Drive, e.g. D:\packages\vcpkg, then set a global environment variable VCPKG\_DEFAULT\_BINARY\_CACHE to that path, e.g. setx /M VCPKG\_DEFAULT\_BINARY\_CACHE D:\packages\vcpkg. If you have already installed packages, move the contents of %LOCALAPPDATA%\vcpkg\archives or %APPDATA%\vcpkg\archives to this directory. Learn more in the vcpkg docs: vcpkg Binary Caching.
 
**Pip cache (Python)**: Create a pip cache directory in your Dev Drive, e.g. D:\packages\pip, then set a global environment variable PIP\_CACHE\_DIR to that path, e.g. setx /M PIP\_CACHE\_DIR D:\packages\pip. If you have already restored pip packages and Wheels on your machine, move the contents of %LocalAppData%\pip\Cache to this directory. Learn more in the pip docs: pip caching and see StackOverflow to Change directory of pip cache on Linux?.
 
**Cargo cache (Rust)**: Create a Cargo cache directory in your Dev Drive, e.g. D:\packages\cargo, then set a global environment variable CARGO\_HOME to that path, e.g. setx /M CARGO\_HOME D:\packages\cargo. If you have already restored Cargo packages on your machine, move the contents of %USERPROFILE%\.cargo to this directory. Learn more in the Cargo docs: Cargo Environmental Variables.
 
**Maven cache (Java)**: Create a Maven cache directory in your Dev Drive, e.g. D:\packages\maven, then set a global environment variable MAVEN\_OPTS to add a configuration setting to that path, e.g. setx /M MAVEN\_OPTS "-Dmaven.repo.local=D:\packages\maven %MAVEN\_OPTS%". Move the contents of %USERPROFILE%\.m2 to this directory. Learn more in the Maven docs and see StackOverflow for How to specify an alternate location for the .m2 folder or settings.xml permanently?.
 
**Gradle cache (Java)**: Create a Gradle cache directory in your Dev Drive, for example, D:\packages\gradle. Then, set a global environment variable GRADLE\_USER\_HOME to point to that path, for example, use setx /M GRADLE\_USER\_HOME "D:\packages\gradle" in the command line to set it system-wide. After setting this variable, Gradle will use the specified directory (D:\packages\gradle) for its caches and configuration files. If you have existing Gradle files, move the contents of %USERPROFILE%\.gradle to this new directory. For more detailed information, you can refer to the Gradle documentation and explore community resources like StackOverflow for tips on managing Gradle configurations and cache directories.
 
Security and trust are important considerations when working with project files. Typically, there is a tradeoff between performance and security. Using a Dev Drive places control over this balance in the hands of developers and security administrators, with a responsibility for choosing which filters are attached and the settings for Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans.
 
Antivirus filters, including both Microsoft Defender and 3rd-party antivirus filters, are attached to a Dev Drive by default. Microsoft Defender Antivirus defaults to the new "performance mode" setting on Dev Drives, taking speed and performance into account, while providing a secure alternative to folder exclusions. For an increased level of protection, Microsoft Defender also offers "Real-time protection mode".
 
Dev Drives can be run with no antivirus filters attached. Exercise extreme caution! Removing antivirus filters is a security risk and means that your storage drive will not be covered by the standard security scans. You are responsible for evaluating the risks associated with detaching antivirus filters and should only do so when confident that your files stored on the Dev Drive will not be exposed to malicious attacks.
 
Dev Drives are automatically designated as trusted using a flag stored in the system registry during the original formatting time, providing the best possible performance by default. A trusted Dev Drive means that the developer using the volume has high confidence in the security of the content stored there.
 
Similar to when a developer chooses to Add an exclusion to Windows Security, the developer takes on the responsibility for managing the security of the content stored in order to gain additional performance.
 
A Dev Drive marked as trusted is a signal for Microsoft Defender to run in performance mode. Running Microsoft Defender in performance mode provides a balance between threat protection and performance. Real-time protection will still be enabled on all other storage volumes.
 
Due to the security considerations of having filters detached, transporting a dev drive between machines will result in the volume being treated as an ordinary volume without special filter attach policies. The volume needs to be marked as trusted when it is attached to a new machine. See How do I designate a Dev Drive as trusted?.
 
An untrusted Dev Drive will not have the same privileges as a trusted Dev Drive. Security will run in real-time protection mode when a Dev Drive is untrusted. Exercise caution if designating trust to a Dev Drive outside of the time that it is first created.
 
The C: drive on your machine cannot be designated as a Dev Drive. Developer tools, such as Visual Studio, MSBuild, .NET SDK, Windows SDK, etc, should be stored on your C: drive and not in a Dev Drive.
 
Performance mode is now available on Windows 11 as a new Microsoft Defender Antivirus capability. This capability reduces the performance impact of Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans for files stored on a designated Dev Drive.
 
By default, Filter Manager will turn OFF all filters on a Dev Drive, with the exception of antivirus filters. An antivirus filter is a filter that's attached in the FSFilter Anti-Virus altitude range (i.e., 320000-329999). FSFilter Anti-Virus includes filters that detect and disinfect viruses during file I/O.
 
disallowAv: Specifies that your Dev Drive(s) do not have any attached filters (not even antivirus). Filters can be added back using fsutil devdrv setfiltersallowed command. (Replacing with
