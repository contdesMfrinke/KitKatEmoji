A randomized trial comparing the amount of knowledge orally recalled from four different presentations of the same consent information was conducted in a non-clinic sample of 233 low-income parents who displayed a range of reading comprehension skill. The study simulated recruitment of children into one of two actual studies underway at another location: one involved high risk to participants, the other did not. Use of a non-clinic sample controlled for prior knowledge of the conditions, and avoiding discussion of the information further assured that differences in recalled information could be attributed more confidently to the format itself. The formats included the original written forms, enhanced print (simpler language, topic headings, pictures), narrated videotapes, and self-paced PowerPoint presentations via laptop computer with bulleted print information, pictures, and narration. No format-related differences in recalled information were found in the full sample but for the 124 individuals with reading comprehension scores at or below the 8th grade level, the enhanced print version tended to be more effective than either the original form or the video. Across all formats, more information was recalled about the low-risk study. The findings emphasize the necessity for clinicians and researchers to verify understanding of consent information, especially when there is risk of reduced literacy skill. Reliance on video to convey information in preference to well-done print media appeared questionable.

The Test of Reading Comprehension-Fourth Edition (TORC-4) is an innovative approach to testing silent reading comprehension that can be used to (a) identify children and adolescents who score significantly below their peers and who therefore might need help in improving their reading proficiency and comprehension, (b) document student progress in remedial programs, and (c) serve as a research tool in studies investigating reading problems in children and adolescents.
 
The TORC-4 was normed on 1,942 students in 14 states. The test has five subtests, all of which measure word identification and contextual meaning. Studies in the TORC-4 manual indicate that the test has high reliability and strong validity, especially criterion-prediction validity.
 
The five subtests are combined to form a composite called the Reading Comprehension Index, a standard score with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This index represents students' ability to understand contextual printed material.
 
I am a reading teacher and I need to make a quiz where the student read a passage and then answer the questions. The problem is that I do not see any option or way to just put the text. I tried putting a picture but it is too small to read even when I click the option to enlarge. Any suggestions?

@lizsanWhy Microsoft haven't added the ability to add a text box is beyond me.. A workaround I've used is to add a new section and put the text into the description box and then add one or more questions relating to that text. Of course you will need to use branching to make this effective.
 
Create a new choice question and delete all available options. Then fill in the question with the text that you want displayed. You can even use a subtitle to provide secondary information.
I'm pretty new at MS Forms, but wanted the same function and just stumbled on this solution.
Hopefully it helps others!
 
Edit: The one drawback I've found is that this still counts as a question in your form data, so it creates a column in the responses, which may not be desirable in every circumstance. No big deal most times though.

The effect of electronic books on the reading comprehension of middle and high school students was examined using an experimental posttest-only control-group design. A convenience sample of 140 randomly assigned middle and high school English students at an independent school in eastern North Carolina participated. Half of the students used passages from text read on tablets while half utilized traditional print text passages. Data was collected during one class period in which the reading comprehension section of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests, a 35 minute test containing 48 questions, was administered. Reading comprehension data was analyzed using an independent t-test. The effect of electronic books on the reading motivation of middle and high school students was examined using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control-group design. All students from the Reading Comprehension testing took the initial Motivations for Reading Questionnaire, a 15-20 minute survey containing 53 questions, on day two. A posttest MRQ was administered in which 27 participants completed the MRQ after reading a book excerpt in paper form, and 27 participants completed the MRQ after reading the same excerpt in electronic form. Reading motivation data was analyzed using a MANOVA. Results demonstrated no significant differences in either reading comprehension or motivation levels based on book format.
 
Deficits in reading, writing, and spelling can affect one or more language domains (see below). For a detailed description of the language domains as they relate to spoken and written language, see Language In Brief.
 
Labels for reading disorders include dyslexia, reading disability, reading disorder, specific reading disorder, and specific reading comprehension deficit. Writing disorder labels also vary, with some being dysgraphia, writing disability, writing disorder, and specific writing disorder.
 
Areas to consider in assessing and treating written language disorders as well as differentially diagnosing within and across spoken and written language disorders are also included below. For more comprehensive lists, see the Assessment and Treatment sections of the Written Language Disorders Practice Portal page.
 
**Word recognition deficit** is sometimes referred to as **dyslexia**. It is characterized by difficulty with reading despite instruction and without coexisting intellectual, sensory, or neurological difficulties. A person with word recognition deficits typically has relatively intact language comprehension but may have difficulties with
 
**Reading comprehension deficit** is sometimes referred to as **specific comprehension deficit** or **hyperlexia**. Hyperlexia can be differentiated from precocious reading, in that individuals with hyperlexia have significant problems in listening and reading comprehension.
 
**Dysgraphia** may refer to either difficulty with language or spelling-based aspects of written expression. Dysgraphia can occur alone or can co-occur with dyslexia and/or other learning disabilities.
 
Deficits in spelling are sometimes called **dysorthography**. Such deficits involve difficulty with encoding phonological information. Spelling difficulties can affect both reading and writing and are an area of weakness for most individuals with dyslexia. Spelling deficits include

The ability to form a mental model of a text is an essential component of successful reading comprehension (RC), and purpose for reading can influence mental model construction. Participants were assigned to one of two conditions during an RC test to alter their purpose for reading: concurrent (texts and questions were presented simultaneously) and sequential (texts were presented first, then questions were shown without text access). Their eye movements were recorded during testing. Working memory capacity (WMC) and centrality of textual information were measured. Participants in the sequential condition had longer first-pass reading times compared to participants in the concurrent condition, while participants in the concurrent condition had longer total processing times per word. In addition, participants with higher WMC had longer total reading times per word. Finally, participants in the sequential condition with higher WMC had longer processing times in central regions. Even among skilled college readers, participants with lower WMC had difficulty adjusting their reading behaviors to meet the task demands such as distinguishing central and peripheral ideas. However, participants with higher WMC increased attention to important text areas. One potential explanation is that participants with higher WMC are better able to construct a coherent mental model of the text, and attending to central text areas is an essential component of mental model formation. Therefore, these results help clarify the relationship between the purpose for reading and mental model development.
