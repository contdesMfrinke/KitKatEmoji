This 6-piece wall decor set offers a creative, glam vibe for your space with a mix of everyday silhouette and extra shine. Each piece is crafted from iron in coordinating but distinct shapes that begin as rectangles. The designs show the look of paper pages blowing in the wind, each with different corners folded or curled or waving. We love that they're painted in a bright metallic gold hue that catches the light and bounces it around the room. The pages all measure around 18'' tall and 10'' wide with variations based on construction. Arrange them together or separately throughout a space.

Inspired by the biblical promise in Luke 4:10 that says, "He will order his angels to protect and guard you," Danish artist Bertel Thorvaldsen sculpted these amazing, angelic images that came to be his best-known works. The angel known as Morning sweetly accompanies a figure known as the Genius of Light, while the angel of Night gently ushers in the allegories of Sleep and Death. Sculpted in bas relief to epitomize the mighty warriors with wings, these replica roundels are cast directly from the museum originals in quality designer resin with a two-tone antique stone and a powder blue finish exclusively for Design Toscano.
 
Full of raw energy and confident sensuality, this dark beauty is decidedly not the stereotypically angelic type. From flowing tresses and bare breasts to curvaceous hips and tattooed skin, we predict that this daring sculpt will bypass the churchyard, and find a proudly symbolic place in your home. Cast in quality designer resin with a gunmetal pewter finish, our Design makes a statement all her own on your gallery or garden wall.

Commercial Group is an interesting case study for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is an example of a company that has achieved a fairly radical environmental transformation in a short period of time. Commercial only began considering low carbon initiatives in 2006 but over the past five years has moved to a position where green issues are now at the core of their business. Normalised carbon emissions have fallen by around 75 per cent since 2006 and waste to landfill has reduced from nine tonnes a year to less than one.
 
Secondly, Commercial's green strategy puts a great deal of emphasis on staff involvement. The company uses a number of mechanisms to involve staff both in implementing green projects and generating ideas for new schemes. In particular, Commercial has experimented with a number of methods for maintaining enthusiasm and momentum in the initiatives. Staff surveys indicate a high level of engagement with the firm's carbon reduction programme.
 
4.1 Commercial Group is an office supplies and procurement company, founded in 1991 and based on a site in Cheltenham. The company's founders remain on the board. It currently employs around 170 people and is in the process of expanding. Commercial's customers are primarily other businesses to whom it provides four main sets of services: Office supplies, office interiors, IT services and support, and printing.
 
4.2 Commercial's carbon reduction programme began in 2006 when the Sales Director (who is also one of the company's founders) attended a talk by Al Gore and a screening of 'An Inconvenient Truth'. The event was one at which clients and other key firms in their sector attended and was intended to have a networking purpose as well. Commercial had always prided itself on being a 'responsible' firm in how it operated, emphasising the quality of services it provides and ensuring staff were well looked after and rewarded. However, the talk alerted her to green issues as an area that a responsible company should be aware of:
 
4.3 Alongside the consideration of green issues as a moral imperative, the company was motivated to engage in low carbon activities due to potential business benefits. Given that the products the company sells (paper, printer cartridges etc.) and services they provide (particularly IT) are key sources of business waste and energy usage, it was anticipated that there would be increasing interest in reducing the environmental impact from both customers and regulators. Greening the business would potentially be a source of competitive advantage in the future.
 
4.4 Low-carbon activity has evolved over several stages. A small informal team was assembled to develop a plan and as part of this a member of staff with interest in green issues was seconded to act as an Environmental Strategist. They spoke to a number organisations involved in providing low-carbon advice and guidance. In addition to larger infrastructure and technical projects, the team was encouraged to look at smaller, more behaviour oriented projects. One team member suggested a bike to work scheme, another suggested introducing double sided printing and set up a system for filtering out junk faxes and a third member suggested replacing disposable paper cups with tumblers.
 
4.5 The plans were then launched more widely across the company and externally. Commercial ran a Corporate Social Responsibility day to advertise their success so far and their intentions to customers. The night before they held a film night showing 'An Inconvenient Truth' which was compulsory for all staff, and outlined their plans to staff. At this stage they had a number of small teams in which staff could get involved on waste management and carbon reduction, allowing staff to make suggestions to identify and deal with inefficiencies within the firm.
 
4.6 After a year and a half of small teams leading low carbon activities, the company found these had got somewhat stale and so they launched the **Green Ambassadors scheme**. This was an initiative to help employees reduce their carbon emissions (and by extension their fuel bills) at home. The scheme was voluntary and involved pr
