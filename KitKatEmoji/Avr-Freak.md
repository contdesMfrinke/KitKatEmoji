A **freak** is a person who is physically deformed or transformed due to an extraordinary medical condition or body modification. This definition was first attested with this meaning in the 1880s as a shorter form of the phrase "freak of nature", itself a broader term meaning "whimsy or caprice of nature", attributed at least as far back as 1847.[1] The term's original neutral connotation became entirely negative during the 20th century; therefore, *freak* with its literal meaning of "abnormally developed individual" is viewed purely as a pejorative today.[2][3] However, the term is also recently used playfully to refer to an enthusiast or obsessive person.
 
Freak saw usage as jargon by promoters and performers of freak shows, though its use in this sense has decreased along with the popularity of freak shows.[4] One well-known example of this word was in reference to Joseph Merrick, the "Elephant Man."[5] As a jargon, side-show freaks were classified into two groups: *natural freaks* and *self-made freaks*.[6] A natural freak would usually have been born with a genetic abnormality, while a self-made freak was a person who was altered artificially (with methods such as surgical implants).

The term has a variety of much more recent meanings. An example is something strikingly unusual about one's appearance or behavior. This usage originated from "freak scene" during the 1960s and 1970s, most famously promoted by the album *Freak Out!* made by the rock band *The Mothers of Invention*.

**W**e are what we practice to become on a daily basis. This process is never-ending, occurs both consciously and unconsciously, and subjective. The following read is about the differences between a leader and a control freak, which are not my own thoughts, however, I find myself familiar with at least a few of them which I try to practice and master. I came across the read and thought I would share it with a greater audience. Many good leaders have already mastered themselves and can be great examples to follow. This read is also to remind me so that consciously or unconsciously I do not realize becoming a control freak (which I often call "manager" and confuse myself). Leadership traits can be within you already, but you need to practice and cherish the good qualities every day to become a good or great leader and avoid turning into a control freak! Hope this helps.
 
Any leadership trait at the extreme end does not lead to success. Leadership style should be flexible and should be adopted based on the situation. Leaders should evaluate themselves from time to time if they are behaving in an extreme way. Anyone can become good to great leaders, with experience.

Feeling like I am right, like I know what to do, delivers a hit of certainty in a world of unending and catastrophic natural disasters, in a country where mass shootings are commonplace and our hot-headed president brags about his ability to start a nuclear war.
 
The opposite of perfectionism is acceptance. Not resignation, but surrender...to whatever is happening in the present moment. I know, I know: That sounds terrible to my fellow control freaks. Bear with me.
 
You may have heard the truism that what we resist, persists. This teaches us that we often prolong pain and difficulty through resistance. Perfectionism is a form of resistance to whatever is actually happening in the present moment. At its foundation, it is a rejection of the current reality.
 
Behavioral science and great wisdom traditions both point us towards acceptance. It is strangely effective to simply accept that which we cannot control, especially if we are in a difficult or painful situation. To do this, we accept the situation, and also our emotions about the situation.
 
Accepting the reality of a difficult or scary situation and our limited control allows us to soften. And this softening opens the door to our own compassion and wisdom.
 
And in this crazy and uncertain life, we human beings need those things.

My earliest recollection of these handmade bikes that were welded and bended and bolted together to be tall or long or just odd or freaky in some way, was at the (now demolished, sniff) Alberta Street Clown House. The clowns were a fun-loving troupe of acrobats and jesters who regaled Last Thursday on Alberta crowds for years before gentrification and other factors pushed them out and the show went dark in 2007. My family loved the carfree street and we instantly took a liking to the antics on the corner of Alberta and 24th.
 
Mini Bike Winter was also a must-attend event if you wanted to get noticed by freak bike veterans. And who recalls Freak Bike Fall? Starting in 2008, this was once an annual event that included an alleycat (urban scavenger hunt on bikes) where participants were required to compete on freak bikes.

Almost every day in my well-used home kitchen, I work with a double standard. I pop something in the oven and dial in a specific temperature, say 175C. However, on the stovetop, I settle for the vagueness of low, medium, or high. When I go see my mother-in-law, and swap my electric range for her gas flames, is my "medium" the same as her medium? No, it is not.
 
Set for release today, Breville PolyScience's Control Freak is a restaurant-grade induction burner that allows a chef to dial in either the surface temperature of a pot or the temperature of the liquid inside it. As someone with the disposition to experiment with the options this presents, this gave me a little frisson, accompanied by the feeling I was seeing the future.
 
The setup of the Control Freak (OK, I'm dropping the "" from Freak now) is similar to a traditional induction burner, but this one has a spring-loaded nubbin that pokes a quarter-inch out of the center and reads the pan's surface temperature. Fill a pot with liquid, mount a temperature probe to its side, and switch to controlling the temperature of the liquid. Cooks can also control how quickly a liquid approaches the target temperature, giving lots of control for something like tempering chocolate, which requires a fair amount of finesse.
 
Take eggs. I put a whole, large egg in water set to 65C (French food scientist Herv This's favorite egg temperature) for 25 minutes and got a white that was just set, and a nice, runny yolk. I tried again, this time putting a dozen eggs in the water and heard the machine rev up to keep the water temperature where I wanted it. I ended up with a dozen perfect eggs. I watched superchef Heston Blumenthal poke a thermometer in a pot of water set to 80C and poach an egg for four minutes that emerged with a nicely set white and runny yolk.
 
Next, I whisked some raw eggs and p
