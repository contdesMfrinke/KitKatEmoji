The Innovation Corps (I-CorpsTM) Teams program is at the heart of the U.S. National Science Foundation's mission to develop and nurture a national innovation network. The I-Corps Teams program supports researchers interested in entrepreneurial education and mentoring, with the goal of reducing the time it takes to bring technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace.

Each team must first submit an executive summary through the application portal. The executive summary must include information about each team member, the proposed technology and the commercial application. Next, the team is invited to an interview with I-Corps staff. A subset of teams is then selected to participate in the National I-Corps training program and submit an I-Corps Teams proposal.
 
Approximately 24 teams participate in the I-Corps Teams program together as a cohort. I-Corps is taught by instructors from the National Innovation Network, a tightly connected organization of university-based Hubs, Nodes, and Sites across the U.S. that implement the I-Corps program.
 
Since the launch of the I-Corps program, participants have formed more than 1,000 startups that have raised over $760 million in funding. Participants who have completed I-Corps have engaged in the follow opportunities, including:
 
Researchers who have a relevant and related research award from NSF that has been active within the past five years in any area of science or engineering are invited to apply to the National I-Corps program.
 
Researchers who have not received a research award from NSF may earn eligibility to the national I-Corps program by first participating in a regional I-Corps program and receiving a letter of recommendation to the national program.

If you're the admin for Microsoft Teams in your organization, you're in the right place. When you're ready to get going with Teams, start with How to roll out Teams and Set up secure collaboration with Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams.
 
Teams is built on Microsoft 365 groups, Microsoft Graph, and the same enterprise-level security, compliance, and manageability as the rest of Microsoft 365. Teams leverages identities stored in Microsoft Entra ID.
 
To customize and extend Teams, add third-party apps using app management tasks. With Teams, you can include people from outside your organization by adding them as a guest or an external user, depending on what you need. Teams offers a robust development platform so you can build the teamwork hub you need for your organization.
 
To stay on top of what's coming for Teams and all other Microsoft 365 products and services in your organization, be sure to check Message center and the Teams roadmap. You'll get announcements about new and updated features, planned changes, and issues to help keep you informed and prepared.
 
Every team is different; there's no one-size-fits-all approach to collaboration. When deciding which apps and services to use, think about the work your organization does and the types of conversations your teams need to have:
 
**Teams**, as the hub for teamwork, is where people--including people outside your organization--can actively connect and collaborate in real time to get things done. Have a conversation right where the work is happening, whether coauthoring a document, having a meeting, or working together in other apps and services. Teams is the place to have informal chats, iterate quickly on a project, work with team files, and collaborate on shared deliverables.
 
**SharePoint** for sites, portals, intelligent content services, business process automation, and enterprise search. SharePoint keeps content at the center of teamwork, making all types of content easily shareable and accessible across teams. Tight integration with Outlook, Viva Engage, and Teams enables seamless content collaboration across conversation experiences.
 
**OneDrive** for storing files and sharing them with people that a user invites. Content that a user saves to OneDrive is private until the user shares it with others, making it the best option for storing personal and draft documents that are not intended to be shared or not ready to be shared.
 
**Viva Engage** to connect people across the organization. Drive company-wide initiatives, share best practices, and build communities around common topics of interest or areas of practice. Crowdsource ideas to foster open discussions with people across the company.
 
If you are an Enterprise user, you can also create a team hierarchy by nesting teams under each other to organize them. Teams above others can see everything owned below them, but the teams under can't see everything owned by the team above them.
 
Users with Super Admin or Add and edit users permission in a **Marketing Hub**, **Sales Hub**, or **Service Hub** Professional or Enterprise account can also assign a user to extra teams.
 
View-only Seats users do not have access to email, chat, or phone support. If you have multiple HubSpot products, your support options are based on your highest subscription. Learn more about getting help with HubSpot.
 
Microsoft Teams shows chats and calls. Is there any way to see the emails in Microsoft Teams too? I mean the emails which are associated with my account and I can check on outlook.com. I could not find any outlook app in Apps.
 
Is it follow-up of Slack's stupid slogan "Slack the email killer"? Tons of addons and apps for Teams and not the single one to handle emails because it is "passe"? Like you expect everyone to stop using emails next week - they want be able to sign to Teams without email address!
 
I love doing everything on Teams but find it pretty annoying when people ping me asking "have you seen the email?" and I need to go there and continue the thread on the email instead of Teams itself because if I don't people get lost and think I did not answer.
 
@Noook agreed. 2 years later and still no app. It is short-sighted to think the world will stop using email. Unless you NEVER receive email from anyone other than your direct teammates who belong to your Team, you will always need email.
 
The fact that I have to toggle between Teams and Outlook to be productive throughout the day is probably the one thing that is preventing me from fully embracing Teams. And it is a hinderance in my efforts to engage others. They are used to a world of email, and that is where their comfort zone is. If I had an app where I could see my email, much the way I can see my calendar, I would log on to Teams in the morning and never leave! And I would be able to more easily bring others along with me.
 
@Rebecca2468 I'm not sure where that ends, don't you also need to toggle to Office apps, web browsers and business applications through the day? Even if it was inside Teams wouldn't you need to be toggling between a view of email and the view of chats/teams, isn't that going to be easier through the task bar in Windows/Mac?
 
The only downside of things I see on this proposal is whatever happens after; you would need to go back to outlook to reply unless you create more advanced flow workflows with response capabilities (cards, bots, logic apps, etc.).

Innovation teams are uniquely positioned to make big dents in tough problems. They gather and use data and look beyond their city limits to learn from other contexts. They are human-centered, tackling challenges by enlisting residents to help define problems and test solutions. They test ideas early to improve them quickly and remain focused on results. And, they are versatile, shouldering challenges across a broad array of city issues and bringing people together across departments to take them on.
 
By default, you automatically have one team in your Autodesk Account under which all your users and Autodesk subscriptions fall. You can optionally create additional teams. Creating additional teams can be helpful when your company has multiple companies or organizations that are not related, but you want to purchase subscriptions centrally for your entire organization. By creating a team for each division, the admins for those teams will only manage the subscriptions their division pays for, instead of all subscriptions your organization owns. You can also move subscriptions between teams and they will continue to be managed under the same primary admin.
 
User names and other personally identifiable information (PII) are included in reports and exported data if Personal Data is enabled in team settings. You can configure personal data reporting for a team.
 
You can assign one primary admin and multiple secondary admins to a team. Each of these admins can be assigned to more than one team. Initially, the subscription owner (the purchaser) defaults to the primary admin.
 
In Autodesk account, creating teams can be helpful when your company has multiple companies or organizations that are not related, but you want to purchase subscriptions centrally for your entire organization. If you are the purchaser, and you are an admin for more than one team, you must assign a team for subscriptions from the Autodesk account portal. Once logged into the Autodesk account portal, from the navigation menu, under User Management, select any of the management options: By User, By Product, or By Group. From th
