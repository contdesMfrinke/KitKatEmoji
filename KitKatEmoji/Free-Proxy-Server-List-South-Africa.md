**Proxy Server List** - this page provides and maintains the largest and the most up-to-date list of working proxy servers that are available for public use. Our powerful software checks over a million proxy servers daily, with most proxies tested at least once every 15 minutes, thus creating one of the most reliable proxy lists on the Internet - all for free.
 
Any **proxy server** listed on this page can be used with a software application that supports the use of proxies such as your web browser. The most popular uses of proxies include hiding your real IP address, disguising your geographic location, and accessing blocked websites.

This **proxy list** is updated once every 60 seconds from the data stored in our gigabyte-sized proxy database. The list can be filtered down by a number of attributes such as the port number of a proxy, country of origin of a proxy, and the level of anonymity of a proxy. You can also view this list on a map.
 
Almost any application, such as your own web-browser, can be configured to route your connections through a **proxy server** for reasons of anonimity or performance. Configuring your browser to use a proxy server is quick and easy, and the instructions for doing that are described in our articles section.
 
However, the recommended alternative to doing all those steps anytime you wish to use a different proxy, is to use our homemade **proxy switcher** that can simplify the whole process to just a few mouse clicks. Our Nova Proxy Switcher can be downloaded from our proxy software page.
 
Your message 'access denied' is more likely to be something blocking specific to your local network (client, hotel, coffee shop, etc.), or even the ISP providing the internet access. I would recommend trying from the southwest app on your cell phone if you can. If that doesn't work, you can always call the 800 number to book.
 
I am in Switzerland and also (still) having this issue on multiple computers (home/office), so I am doubting it is in fact a local IP provider/settings issue. As I've lived abroad for 15+ years and conduct lots of online business with the US (including with Southvest in previuous years), I must say that I've actually NEVER experienced any similar issue with any other company before (from within or outside of the US). Did you 100% verify with the Southwest IT department that the issue definitively does NOT stem from your side?
 
Having to check multiple flights/dates/times/prices on my phone or call the 1-800 number (which is not free of charge from outside the US!) is quite annoying when I would like to simply and easily book directly online myself in real time - i.e. standard consumer practice in 2016.

I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble accessing our site. We've been made aware that some Customers outside of North America are experiencing trouble with Southwest.com, and we are working hard to resolve this issue. In the meantime, we'd be happy to help you via Twitter or Facebook or you can call 1-800-435-9792.
 
In summary, we know that there are some folks outside the US that are having difficulty reaching Southwest.com, and we're hard at work to fix it. Hope to have the functionality restored sooner than later. In the meantime, you can always reach out to us on Facebook or Twitter for booking assistance.
 
Not a very satisfying answer. Looking at this thread it goes back several months. I represent a rather large travel company and this is having an impact on my ability to service my customers. Is there a tech support group that I can speak to and open a ticket with? This is only happening from one proxy server. How can you fix it if you don't have the details of the problem.
 
I've also had this problem in Singapore, going back several months. At the time we thought it was a change by Southwest to restrict access from overseas, perhaps for security reasons, as we could connect to the website when we built a VPN into the States. Due to the inability to access Southwest outside of the VPN (which we had borrowed for the test), we've been forced to use United for our travel on visits to the States --- which is a complete shame as we like Southwest and used the airline on our visits to see family Stateside.
 
To connect to your WorkSpaces, the network that your WorkSpaces clients are connected to must have certain ports open to the IP address ranges for the various AWS services (grouped in subsets). These address ranges vary by AWS Region. These same ports must also be open on any firewall running on the client. For more information about the AWS IP address ranges for different Regions, see AWS IP Address Ranges in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
 
This port is used to access DNS servers. It must be open to your DNS server IP addresses so that the client can resolve public domain names. This port requirement is optional if you are not using DNS servers for domain name resolution.
 
This port is used for client application updates, registration, and authentication. The desktop client applications support the use of a proxy server for port 443 (HTTPS) traffic. To enable the use of a proxy server, open the client application, choose **Advanced Settings**, select **Use Proxy Server**, specify the address and port of the proxy server, and choose **Save**.
 
This port is used for streaming the WorkSpace desktop and health checks for PCoIP WorkSpaces. This port must be open to the PCoIP Gateway and to the health check servers in the Region that the WorkSpace is in. For more information, see Health check servers and PCoIP gateway servers.
 
For PCoIP WorkSpaces, the desktop client applications do not support the use of a proxy server nor TLS decryption and inspection for port 4172 traffic in UDP (for desktop traffic). They require a direct connection to ports 4172.
 
This port is used for streaming the WorkSpace desktop and health checks for WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol (WSP) WorkSpaces. This port must be open to the WSP Gateway IP address ranges and the health check servers in the Region that the WorkSpace is in. For more information, see Health check servers and WSP gateway servers.
 
For WSP WorkSpaces, the WorkSpaces Windows client application (version 5.1 and above) and macOS client application (version 5.4 and above) support the use of HTTP proxy servers for port 4195 TCP traffic, but the use of a proxy is not recommended. TLS decryption and inspection are not supported. For more information, see **Configure device proxy server settings for internet access** for Windows WorkSpaces, Amazon Linux WorkSpaces, and Ubuntu WorkSpaces.
 
If your firewall uses stateful filtering, ephemeral ports (also known as dynamic ports) are automatically opened to allow return communication. If your firewall uses stateless filtering, you must open ephemeral ports explicitly to allow return communication. The required ephemeral port range that you must open will vary depending on your configuration.
 
Proxy server function is not supported for UDP traffic. If you choose to use a proxy server, the API calls that the client application makes to the Amazon WorkSpaces services are also proxied. Both API calls and desktop traffic should pass through the same proxy server.
 
For WorkSpaces that are configured for WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol (WSP), this port is used for streaming the WorkSpaces desktop traffic. This port must be open to the WSP Gateway IP address ranges. For more information, see WSP gateway servers.
 
If your firewall uses stateful filtering, ephemeral ports (also known as dynamic ports) are automatically opened to allow return communication. If your firewall uses stateless filtering, you must open ephemeral ports explicitly to allow return communication. The required ephemeral port range that you must open varies depending on your configuration.
 
Typically, the web browser randomly selects a source port in the high range to use for streaming traffic. WorkSpaces Web Access does not have control over the port that the browser selects. You must ensure that return traffic to this port is allowed.
 
For the WorkSpaces client application to be able to access the WorkSpaces service, you must add the following domains and IP addresses to the allow list on the network from which the client is trying to access the service.
 
The WorkSpaces client applications perform health checks over ports 4172 and 4195. These checks validate whether TCP or UDP traffic streams from the WorkSpaces servers to the client applications. For these checks to finish successfully, your firewall policies must allow outbound traffic to the IP addresses of the following Regional health check servers.
 
WorkSpaces uses PCoIP to stream the desktop session to clients over port 4172. For its PCoIP gateway servers, WorkSpaces uses a small range of Amazon EC2 public IPv4 addresses. This enables you to set more finely grained firewall policies for devices that access WorkSpaces. Note that the WorkSpaces clients do not support IPv6 addresses as a connectivity option at this time.
 
Starting in June 2020, WorkSpaces streams the desktop session for WSP WorkSpaces to clients over port 4195 instead of port 4172. If you want to use WSP WorkSpaces, make sure that port 4195 is open to traffic.
 
WorkSpaces uses a small range of Amazon EC2 public IPv4 addresses for its WSP gateway servers. This enables you to set more finely grained firewall policies for devices that access WorkSpaces. Note that the WorkSpaces clients do not support IPv6 addresses as a connectivity option at this time.
 
The management network interface (eth0) is connected to a secure WorkSpaces management network. It is used for interactive streaming of the WorkSpace desktop to WorkSpaces clients, and to allow WorkSpaces to manage the WorkSpace.
